"Paris","Paris' monument-lined boulevards, museums, classical bistros and boutiques are enhanced by a new wave of multimedia galleries, creative wine bars, design shops and tech start-ups.\n\nIconic Architecture\n\nThe cloud-piercing, wrought-iron Eiffel Tower, broad Arc de Triomphe guarding the glamorous avenue des Champs-Élysées, flying buttressed Notre Dame cathedral, lamplit bridges spanning the Seine and art nouveau cafes' wicker-chair-lined terraces are enduring Parisian emblems. Despite initial appearances, however, Paris’ cityscape isn’t static: there are some stunning modern and contemporary icons, too, from the inside-out, industrial-style Centre Pompidou to the mur végétal (vertical garden) gracing the Musée du Quai Branly, the glass sails of the Fondation Louis Vuitton contemporary-art centre, and the gleaming steel egg-shaped concert venue La Seine Musicale.\n\nGlorious Food\n\nFrance’s reputation for its cuisine (the French word for ‘kitchen’) precedes it, and whether you seek a cosy neighbourhood bistro or a triple-Michelin-starred temple to gastronomy, you'll find that every establishment prides itself on exquisite preparation and presentation of quality produce, invariably served with wine. Enticing patisseries, boulangeries (bakeries), fromageries (cheese shops) and crowded, colourful street markets are perfect for putting together a picnic to take to the city’s beautiful parks and gardens. A host of culinary courses – held anywhere from home kitchens to the world’s most prestigious cookery schools – offers instruction for all schedules, abilities and budgets.\n\nStylish Shopping\n\nThe word 'Parisian' is synonymous with style, and fashion shopping is the city’s forte. Paris remains at the forefront of international trends, and browsing emerging and established designer boutiques and flagship haute couture houses is a quintessential part of any visit. You’ll also find hip concept and homewares shops, and resplendent art nouveau department stores, along with a trove of vintage shops and flea markets, atmospheric bookshops and dark-green bouquiniste stalls stocking secondhand titles along the riverbanks, adorable children’s wear and toy shops, art and antique dealers, venerable establishments selling professional cookware, and, of course, gourmet-food and wine shops galore.\n\nArtistic Treasures\n\nWith an illustrious artistic pedigree – Renoir, Rodin, Picasso, Monet, Manet, Dalí and Van Gogh are but a few of the masters who have lived and worked here over the years – Paris is one of the world's great art repositories, harbouring treasures from antiquity onwards. In addition to big hitters like the incomparable Louvre, the Musée d’Orsay’s exceptional impressionist collection, and the Centre Pompidou’s cache of modern and contemporary art, scores of smaller museums showcase every imaginable genre, a diverse range of venues mount major exhibitions through to offbeat installations, and there's also the city's vibrant street art.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/paris"
"Lyon","Commanding a strategic spot at the confluence of the Rhône and the Saône Rivers, Lyon has been luring people ever since the Romans named it Lugdunum in 43 BC. Commercial, industrial and banking powerhouse for the past 500 years, Lyon is France's third-largest city, and offers today's urban explorers a wealth of enticing experiences.\n\nOutstanding museums, a dynamic cultural life, busy clubbing and drinking scenes, a thriving university and fantastic shopping lend the city a distinctly sophisticated air, while adventurous gourmets can indulge in their wildest gastronomic fantasies. Don't leave the city without sampling some Lyonnais specialities in a bouchon – the quintessential Lyon experience.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/burgundy-and-the-rhone/lyon"
"Nice","With its mix of real-city grit, old-world opulence, year-round sunshine, vibrant street life and stunning seaside location, no place in France compares with Nice.\n\nMediterranean Magnetism\n\nBefore everything else, there was the sea, and the Mediterranean climate – the twin factors that made Nice a tourist magnet as early as the 1700s. Look around and you’ll find the same elemental attractions that drew Europe's belle-époque aristocrats to promenade along the waterfront in horse-drawn carriages. Even now, nothing compares to the simple joy of a balmy beach day interspersed with a spot of people-watching astride the Promenade des Anglais' famous blue chairs. Whether you're skating, kayaking, swimming, sprawled on a beach lounger or transfixed by sunset over the ever-present Med, it's all still happening by the water.\n\nThe Italian Influence\n\nFor any lover of French and Italian culture, Nice is the perfect hybrid. Long affiliated with Piedmont and Liguria to the east, Savoy to the north and Sardinia to the south, this city only joined France in 1860 and has always kept one foot in Italy. The Italian influence remains palpable everywhere, in Vieux Nice's tall-shuttered, ochre-hued buildings that look airlifted straight in from Portofino, in the fresh pasta shops on every corner and even in the football cheer Issa Nissa! (Go Nice!), shouted in the local Nissart dialect that’s been coloured by Ligurian Italian as much as Occitan French.\n\nCity of Artists\n\nThe Côte d'Azur has ensnared many a visitor with the beauty of its light. Not least Henri Matisse, who came here to convalesce from bronchitis. When the sun finally emerged after a month of wintry drizzle, Matisse was so smitten that he made Nice his home for the next 37 years. Chagall, Picasso and Renoir also fell in love with this place, and Nice was later home to the influential avant-garde École de Nice. Art museums abound throughout the region, but Nice's three superstars – the Musées Matisse, Chagall and d’Art Moderne – are reason enough to justify an aesthetic pilgrimage here.\n\nEating Niçois-Style\n\nBring your appetite when you come to Nice. This city is meant for epicures. It all starts at Vieux Nice’s Saleya market, where small producers from the Alpine foothills bring in a bounty of fresh produce, and top chefs from surrounding restaurants shop right beside tourists. The city celebrates its uniqueness with street snacks like socca (chickpea pancakes), pissaladière (caramelised onion tart) or tourte de blettes (chard, raisin and pine nut pie), while its countless cosy bistros serve everything from hearty Provençal beef stew to true salade niçoise to pasta with pistou, and from fresh lemon tart to vegan cheesecake.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/nice"
"Marseille","Grit and grandeur coexist seamlessly in Marseille, an exuberantly multicultural port city with a pedigree stretching back to classical Greece and a fair claim to the mantle of France's second city. Once seen as somewhat dirty and dangerous, and lacking the glamour of Cannes or St-Tropez, this black sheep of the Provençal coastline has blossomed in cultural confidence since its 2013 stint as the European Capital of Culture. The addition of a brace of swanky new museums is just the outward sign of an optimism and self-belief that's almost palpable.\n\nMarseille's heart is the vibrant Vieux Port (old port), mast-to-mast with yachts and pleasure boats. Just uphill is the ancient Le Panier neighbourhood, the oldest section of the city. Also worth an explore is the République quarter, with its stylish boutiques and Haussmannian buildings, and the Joliette area, centred on Marseille’s totemic Cathédrale de Marseille Notre Dame de la Major.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/provence/marseille"
"Bordeaux","An intoxicating cocktail of 18th-century savoir-faire, millennial hi-tech and urban street life, France's sixth largest city is among Europe's most exciting and gutsy players.\n\nArt & Architecture\n\nThis is the world's largest urban World Heritage Site, cradling half the city (18 sq km) in its Unesco-listed treasure chest. From the elegant symmetry of place de la Bourse, palaces strung with stone-sculpted mascarons (faces), to tree-shaded boulevards laced with hôtels particuliers (mansions) built for 18th-century wine merchants, Bordeaux architecture is world-class. Contemporary architects continue the trend for excellence, with breathtakingly wild and beautiful creations resembling giant wine decanters, gleaming white pebbles, all sorts. An interesting portfolio of art museums embracing all periods and genres is the icing on the cake to this magnificent architectural heritage.\n\nRiverside Riches\n\nStriding through Bordeaux on its leggy route north past traditional wine-producing chateaux to the Atlantic Ocean, the River Garonne is never far away. From this Gallo-Roman city's golden past as medieval wine trader and key port in Europe during the Age of Enlightenment, to the prestigious vineyards and vibrant quayside culture the river fuels today, the Garonne has been the city's lifeline since birth. Be it strolling, jogging or cycling along the silky-smooth water's edge in a loop from Left to Right Bank, lounging over drinks on a riverside terrace or cruising along the water, Bordeaux's riverside riches merit your full attention.\n\nGastronomy & Fine Wine\n\nThis is a wine capital hemmed in by green, sun-drenched vineyards. Viticulture here is an ancient art and tradition bearing its own unique trademarks and no other vineyards in the world produce as much fine wine. Best up, from celebrated premiers crus aged for years to the very first vin nouveau cracked open at festivals after the autumnal harvest, dégustation (tasting) is an intrinsic part of daily life. Paired with the city's exceptional dining scene – a sassy mix of traditional French kitchens, experimental neobistros, creative fusion restaurants, food trucks and barista-run coffee shops – there is no tastier marriage. Santé!\n\nBordelais Art de Vivre\n\nIt's hard to believe that this was a city that fell under British rule for three hundred years (from the coronation of Henry of Aquitaine as King Henry II of England in 1152). Staunchly Bordelais to the last breath, Bordeaux enjoys an overwhelming sense of local pride and savoir faire. Innovation is her middle name and a high-spirited, university-student population bolsters the compelling undercurrent of creativity rippling through the city. Peppering a tramline with monumental pieces of contemporary art, partying in a WWII submarine bunker, and dancing on a barge at the industrial wet docks is all second nature to this natural bon vivant.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/southwestern-france/bordeaux"
"Toulouse","Ochre rooftops and blushing brick churches earned Toulouse the nickname ‘La Ville Rose’ (The Pink City). Its enchanting Vieux Quartier (Old Quarter) is a dreamy jumble of coral-coloured shopfronts and churches. Beyond the old town, Toulouse sprawls into France’s fourth-largest metropolis. It’s an animated, hectic place, but Toulouse – nestled between a bend in the Garonne River and the mighty Canal du Midi – is invigorated by its waterways.\n\nToulouse has one of the largest universities outside Paris: at its core this southwestern French city is home to students and scientists. French aeronautical history continues in the Airbus factory outside town. But Toulouse knows how to have a good time, whether in teeming food markets, salons de thé or the thick of its smouldering jazz, techno and rock scenes. From the tips of dusky pink spires to its loudest bars, time spent in Toulouse truly has a rose-tinted sheen.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/toulouse"
"Strasbourg","Strasbourg is the perfect overture to all that is idiosyncratic about Alsace – walking a fine tightrope between France and Germany and between a medieval past and a progressive future, it pulls off its act in inimitable Alsatian style.\n\nTear your gaze away from that mesmerising Gothic cathedral for just a minute and you’ll be roaming the old town’s twisting alleys lined with crooked half-timbered houses à la Grimm; feasting in the cosiest of winstubs (Alsatian taverns) by the canals in Petite France; and marvelling at how a city that does Christmas markets and gingerbread so well can also be home to the glittering EU Quarter and France’s second-largest student population. But that’s Strasbourg for you: all the sweeter for its contradictions and cross-cultural quirks.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/alsace-and-lorraine/strasbourg"
"Montpellier","Graceful and easy-going, Montpellier is a stylish metropolis with elegant buildings, grand hôtels particuliers (private mansions), stately boulevards and shady backstreets, and gorgeous white-sand beaches on its doorstep.\n\nUnlike many southern towns, Montpellier has no Roman heritage. It was founded in the 10th century by the counts of Toulouse and later became a prosperous trading port as well as a scholarly centre – Europe’s first medical school was established here in the 12th century.\n\nThe population swelled in the 1960s when many French settlers left independent Algeria and relocated here, and it’s now France's fastest-growing city and one of its most multicultural. Students make up over a third of the population, giving it a spirited vibe.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/languedoc-roussillon/montpellier"
"Lille","Capital of the Hauts-de-France région, Lille may be France's most underrated metropolis. Recent decades have seen the country's fourth-largest city (by greater urban area) transform from an industrial centre into a glittering cultural and commercial hub. Highlights include its enchanting old town with magnificent French and Flemish architecture, renowned art museums, stylish shopping, outstanding cuisine, a nightlife scene bolstered by 67,000 university students, and some 1600 designers in its environs.\n\nIn 2020, Lille will become the World Design Capital (the first French city to do so), with design agencies and other creative enterprises opening their doors to the public, and exhibitions and festivities throughout the year.\n\nThanks to the Eurostar and the TGV, Lille makes an easy, environmentally sustainable weekend destination from London, Paris, Brussels and beyond.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/northern-france/lille"
"Nantes","You can take Nantes out of Brittany (as when regional boundaries were redrawn during WWII), but you can't take Brittany out of its long-time capital, Nantes (Naoned in Breton).\n\nSpirited and innovative, this artsy city on the banks of the Loire has a history of reinventing itself. It was founded by Celts around 70 BC and in AD 937 it joined the duchy of Brittany. The Edict of Nantes, a landmark royal charter guaranteeing civil rights to France's Huguenots (Protestants), was signed in Nantes by Henri IV in 1598.\n\nBy the 18th century Nantes was France's foremost port, and in the 19th century – following the abolition of slavery – it became an industrial centre; the world's first public transport service, the omnibus, began here in 1826. Shipbuilding anchored the city's economy until the late 20th century and when the shipyards relocated westwards to St-Nazaire, Nantes transformed itself into a thriving student and cultural hub.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/southwestern-france/nantes"
"Udon Thani","Udon Thani, or Udon for short, is an important regional hub that connects northeastern Thailand with the rest of the country as well as neighbouring Laos. Once a far-flung, sleepy provincial town, Udon sprang into action when the Thai and US governments built a joint-force military base there during the Vietnam War, bringing a large influx of GIs and Vietnamese immigrants to the city, thus creating a multi-culturally diverse base which lasts until today.\n\nBesides its military past, Udon is home to one of the world’s earliest bronze-age civilizations, at Ban Chiang. Archaeological evidence – earthenware pottery and bronze fragments – unearthed here suggest that the prehistoric settlements existed between 2100BC and 200AD. Other ancient structures and artifacts are also found inside Phu Phra Baht Historical Park. Here, rising amidst a vast sandstone mountain are peculiar rock formations, as well as dinosaur foot prints, cave paintings and Buddhist structures.\n\nUdon is approximately 560km from Bangkok. The urban centre, Udon City, is home to a large concentration of expats, some of whom settled down here after the war. Udon’s dining and nightlife scene is, therefore, culturally diverse and offers good choices.","http://www.thailand-guide.com/udon-thani/"
"Bangkok","Bangkok welcomes more visitors than any other city in the world and it doesnt take long to realise why. Bangkok is a city of contrasts with action at every turn. Marvel at the gleaming temples, catch a tuk tuk through bustling Chinatown or take a longtail boat through floating markets. Food is another Bangkok highlight, from local dishes served at humble street stalls to haute cuisine at romantic rooftop restaurants.\n\nLuxury malls compete with a sea of boutiques and markets, where you can treat yourself without overspending. Extravagant luxury hotels and surprisingly cheap serviced apartments welcome you with the same famed Thai hospitality. And no visit to Bangkok would be complete without a glimpse of its famous nightlife. Be it nightclubs, cabarets or exotic red-light districts, Bangkok never ceases to amaze.","https://www.hoteis.com/go/thailand/bangkok?pos=HCOM_BR&locale=pt_BR"
"Samut Prakan","Samut Prakan province is situated only twenty-five kilometers from Bangkok, just north of the Gulf of Thailand. The old section of the district is still referred to as Pak Nam, which means River mouth, a logical name for the city at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River. Samut Prakan Province covers 1,004 square kilometers of seasonally flooded plains, crisscrossed by canals.\n\nSamut Prakan is not a popular tourist destination in and of itself and therefore there are few guesthouses or hotels; however, because of its proximity to Bangkok many visitors make day trips from the capital to see the attractions in Samut Prakan, including the Ancient City, the Erawan museum, and the Crocodile Farm. As Samut Prakan has many expatriate foreigners, English is commonly spoken and there are shops and restaurants that cater to foreign residents and visitors.\n\nSamut Prakan is located next to Bangkok. The north borders Bangkok and Chachoengsao, the east borders Chachoengsao, the south is the Gulf of Thailand, and the west is Bangkok,\n\nThe geography is all flatland and plains with the Chao Phraya River running through the city on its way to the Gulf of Thailand. Its coast is 47.5 kilometers long. Samut Prakan, Thailand, is known as the province of industry, Fishing, and agriculture.","https://portal.tourismthailand.org/About-Thailand/Destination/Samut-Prakan"
"Nonthaburi","Nonthaburi is a province in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. Some areas of the province have been as well-urbanized as the capital city Bangkok. It is densely populated with condominiums, office buildings and housing estates. Interestingly, travelers can still find many agricultural areas in Nonthaburi and some communities still enjoy the simplicity of the local way of livings. The province possesses many tourist attractions.\n\nNonthaburi is divided into 6 districts, which are Mueang Nonthaburi, Pak Kret, Bang Kruai, Bang Yai, Bang Bua Thong, and Sai Noi.\n\nThanks to its proximity to Bangkok and conveniently accessible by road and River transportation, Nonthaburi is a province rich of interesting tourist attractions that should not be overlooked.\n\nNonthaburi has been inhabited for over 400 years, dating back to the time when Ayutthaya was the capital of the Kingdom. The town was originally located at Tambon Baan Talat Khwan, a famous fruit orchard through which the Chao Phraya River and various Canals pass.\n\nKing Prasat Thong ordered the digging of a canal as a shortcut from the south of Wat Thai Muang to Wat Khema because the old waterway flowed into Om River to Bang Yai then to Bang Kruai Canal next to Wat Chalo before ending in front of Wat Khema.\n\nAfter the new shortcut was completed, the Chao Phraya River changed its flow into the new route that it follows to this day. In 1665, King Narai the Great noticed that the new route gave enemies too much proximity to the capital. Therefore, he ordered that a fortress be built at the mouth of Om River and relocated Nonthaburi to this area. While the fortress was demolished during the reign of King Rama III so that the bricks could be used for the construction of Wat Chalerm Phra Kiat, a city shrine still stands on the site.\n\nNonthaburi is situated in a fertile basin on the bank of the Chao Phraya River, where many fruit and flower plantations are interspersed with a number of Historical temples. The town is only 20 km from Bangkok and is conveniently accessible by road or river.\n\nThe History of Nonthaburi dates back to the Ayutthaya Kingdom as it is strategically located along the Chao Phraya River. The provincial slogan sheds light on the attractions in Nonthaburi, mentioning the Grand Royal Mansion, acclaimed Royal Garden, pottery of Koh Kret, beautiful temples, tasty durians, and the magnificent government hall.","https://www.tourismthailand.org/Destinations/Provinces/Nonthaburi/226"
"Chonburi","Chonburi is another popular tourist destination in Thailand. Only 81 kilometers away from Bangkok, it has long been famous for magnificent Beaches and Sea views. The province consists of ten Amphoes, which are Mueang Chonburi, Nong Yai, Phanat Nikhom, Ban Bueng, Phan Thong, Bo Thong, Sriracha, Bang Lamung, Sattahip, and Koh Si Chang.\n\nTourist attractions in Chonburi, Thailand, can serve all types of visitors.

Chonburi is also a heaven for beach lovers, with hotspots like Bang Saen, Pattaya, and Koh Lan. Nong Mon Market is where you can shop for local souvenirs such as handcrafted products and delicious foods like Ho Mok or Thai steamed fish curry, Khao Lam or sweet sticky rice in bamboo, sweet banana and taro chips, and candied fruits.\n\nOther suggested places in Chonburi travel guides include Jomtien Beach, Nong Nooch Tropical Garden, Sriracha Tiger Zoo, Prasat Sajja Tham (Sanctuary of Truth), Khao Kheow Open Zoo, Four Regions Floating Market, Koh Samed, Koh Si Chang, Koh Samae San, and Mini Siam.\n\nWith this great variety of attractions and activities to offer, this is a city you should not miss!\n\nChonburi, Bangkok’s nearest seaside town, is located on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Thailand, only 80 kilometers from the capital. The area boasts abundant natural resources, which are highlighted by delightful beaches, local traditions, regional delicacies, and fresh Seafood.

"Nakhon Ratchasima","Nakhon Ratchasima or Korat Thailand is the most prosperous province of the East. Its richness of Culture is very interesting since it has its own folk song called ‘Pleng Korat.’ Nakhon Ratchasima is also important to Thai History. All ranges of tourist attractions are available here that you need to take quite some time to visit all of them.\n\nLocating a few hours away from Bangkok with easy transportation the province is very popular for tourists, especially in Khao Yai National Park.\n\nNakhon Ratchasima is the biggest province in Thailand in term of space. To its greatness, there are 32 districts which are; Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Buri, Soeng Sang, Khong, Ban Lueam, Chakkarat, Chok Chai, Dan Khun Thot, Non Thai, Non Sung, Kham Sakaesaeng, Bua Yai, Prathai, Pak Thong Chai, Phimai, Huai Thalaeng, Chum Phuang, Sung Noen, Kham Thale So, Sikhio, Pak Chong, Nong Bun Mak, Kaeng Sanam Nang, Non Daeng, Wang Nam Khiao, Thepharak, Mueang Yang, Phra Thong Kham, Lam Thamenchai, Bua Lai, Sida\n\nNakhon Ratchasima, otherwise known as Khorat, is the largest northeastern province, and the inhabitants of the province are mainly engaged in agricultural activities, growing such diverse crops as rice, sugar cane, sesame, and fruit. There are more than 100 savings and agricultural cooperatives in the province, 35 irrigation projects, and 7,122 industrial factories. Most of the factories are rice mills, tapioca product manufacturers, and industrial factories.\n\nHistorically, Khorat Province was an important area for thousands of years, first as the site of several ancient prehistoric communities and later as important outposts of the Dvaravati and Khmer Empires. Ruins of both Dvaravati and Khmer Temples are located across Khorat, particularly at Amphoe Sung Noen and Amphoe Phimai, the latter one of the most important provincial capitals of the Angkorian Empire.\n\nTo this day, Khorat remains an important province and city, functioning as Northeastern Thailand’s main transportation hub and economic center. Finally, as Khorat’s Amphoe Pak Thong Chai is considered the spiritual home of the Thai silk weaving industry, those interested in sericulture will enjoy Shopping for some of the country’s best cloth..\n\nNakhon Ratchasima, generally known as Khorat, is Thailand’s largest province. Situated on Thailand’s sprawling northeastern plateau, approximately 260 kilometers northeast of Bangkok, the city itself serves as the gateway to the lower northeastern region.\n\nCovering an area that is mainly plateaus and mountainous terrain, Khorat has fascinating traditions, charming hospitality, splendid natural scenery and awesome historical sites, including Khao Yai, Thailand’s oldest national park and newest World Heritage site, and the Khmer temple at Phimai, an important provincial capital of the Angkor Empire.","https://www.tourismthailand.org/Destinations/Provinces/Nakhon-Ratchasima/580"
"Chiang Mai","Chiang Mai province is in Northern Thailand. The Chiang Mai weather is always cooler than the rest of the country, with an average temperature of 25°C throughout the year. The city has plethora of things to see and things to do. The beauty of the mountains, hill tribe villages, and botanical gardens attracts millions of tourists to Chiang Mai every year. You can also enjoy a Zoo and Aquarium, a nocturnal zoo, and classic Northern Thai temples and architecture which are a Fusion of Lanna, Mon, and Burmese styles.\n\nThe north of Chiang Mai borders the Shan state of Myanmar. Cross-border trade is allowed at Kew Pha Wok checkpoint in Amphoe Chiang Dao and Ban Lak Taeng checkpoint in Amphoe Wiang Haeng, so both are tourist sites and places for cultural exchanges between two nations. \n\nThe south is next to Amphoe Sam Ngao, Amphoe Mae Ramad, and Amphoe Tha Song Yang of Tak Province, with tourist attractions like Bhumibol Dam, Sam Ngao Cliff, Mae Kasa Waterfall, and Thee Mo Bo Waterfall.\n\nThe east is next to Amphoe Mae Fah Luang, Amphoe Mueang Chiang Rai, Amphoe Mae Suai, and Amphoe Wiang Pa Pao of Chiang Rai Province, Amphoe Mueang Pan and Amphoe Mueang Lampang of Lampang Province, and Amphoe Ban Thi, Amphoe Mueang Lamphun, Amphoe Pa Sang, Amphoe Wiang Nong Long, Amphoe Ban Hong, and Amphoe Li of Lamphun Province.\n\nThe west is next to Amphoe Pai, Amphoe Mueang Mae Hong Son, Amphoe Khun Yuam, Amphoe Mae La Noi, Amphoe Mae Sariang, and Amphoe Sob Moei of Mae Hong Son Province. Most popular places are Amphoe Pai, Pang Oung, and Doi Mae U-kho.\n\nChiang Mai has a long History. It was once the capital of the Lanna Kingdom. Nowadays it is a very modern city, similar to Bangkok.\n\nChiang Mai literally means “new city” and has retained the name despite celebrating its 700th anniversary in 1996. King Meng Rai the Great founded the city as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom on Thursday, April 12, 1296 around the same time as the establishment of the Sukhothai Kingdom. King Meng Rai even conferred with his friends, King Ramkhamhaeng of Sukhothai and King Ngam Muang of Phayao before choosing the site where the capital of the Lanna Kingdom was to be founded. Henceforth, Chiang Mai not only became the capital and cultural core of the Lanna Kingdom, it was also to be the center of Buddhism in northern Thailand. King Meng Rai himself was a very religious leader who even founded many of the city’s temples that remain important to this day. Chiang Mai is one of the few places in Thailand where it is possible to experience both Historical and modern Thai Culture coexisting side by side: the city features centuries-old pagodas and temples next to modern convenience stores and boutique hotels. This dichotomy is best appreciated within the moat-encircled old city, which retains much of the fortified wall that once protected the city center as well as the four main gates that provided access to the former Lanna capital city. Strangely, for many years, tourists had mistaken Chiang Mai simply as the base from which they could plan Trekking and Rafting trips to hill tribe villages and explore other provinces. Once in Chiang Mai, however, tourists are surprised by the fact that there are so many things to discover other than its beautiful and historic temples. Intriguing diversity among ethnic tribes, a number of elephant camps, many cooking and massage schools, numerous outdoor activities, a variety of handicrafts workshops, various cultural performances, and breathtaking scenery make Chiang Mai one of Asia’s most attractive tourist destinations. The phrase a day in Chiang Mai is enough to see things around town was once a common expression. Today, two weeks in Chiang Mai may not be long enough for travelers to experience all that Chiang Mai has to offer.\n\nThe old city of Chiang Mai is a showcase of the north’s fascinating indigenous cultural identity that includes diverse dialects, a delectable cuisine, distinctive architecture, traditional values, lively festivals, numerous handicrafts workshops, northern style massage, and classical dances. Chiang Mai is also blessed with pristine natural resources including mountains, waterfalls, and Rivers. The presence of numerous hill tribes that feature a wealth of unique cultures enhances Chiang Mai’s distinctive diversity. Hill tribe trekking often combined with river rafting and elephant riding has always been one of Chiang Mai’s greatest tourist attractions. Nowadays there are innumerable activities and attractions both in the city and the surrounding province, including massage instruction and golf. Moreover, visitors can visit workshops where they can learn about the production of silk or silver, and purchase memorable, hand-crafted souvenirs. With such a diverse range of attractions and an equally grand selection of dining and accommodation options, Chiang Mai is a place where both backpackers and luxury tourists can enjoy the ultimate Thailand holiday.","https://www.tourismthailand.org/Destinations/Provinces/Chiang-Mai/101"
"Hat Yai","Hat Yai is a large Amphoe of Songkhla province. It is 26 kilometers away from Songkhla city and 60 kilometers away from Sadao immigration checkpoint.

Hat Yai is located roughly 950 km (600 miles) from Bangkok and just 30 km (18.5 miles) from the Malaysian border.

"Sri racha","sauceWhilst the most recognised brand of sauce, Huy Fong, is Vietnamese-American, sriracha actually originated in Thailand. According to the Thai Chomrom Rak Sri Racha (or Sri Racha Lovers’ Association in English) the sauce itself was created by Burmese sawmill workers in the town of Sriracha, about 120km away from Bangkok.

Everyone has heard of the delicious, spicy hot sauce sriracha – it can be found in kitchens the world over, is featured in thousands of recipes and is even available as a key chain. However, few people know of its humble origins in the coastal Thai town of Sri Racha, in Chonburi province. Here’s a quick guide to the history of the sauce, and things to do in this sleepy seaside spot.\n\nWhilst the most recognised brand of sauce, Huy Fong, is Vietnamese-American, sriracha actually originated in Thailand. According to the Thai Chomrom Rak Sri Racha (or Sri Racha Lovers’ Association in English) the sauce itself was created by Burmese sawmill workers in the town of Sriracha, about 120km away from Bangkok. Workers would take the ingredients, pound them together with a pestle and mortar and share between themselves, before then starting to sell it to customers.\n\nToday, it’s a global phenomenon.

Watching a game is a local rite of passage, whether you slather on the blue-and-orange body paint for a Bears football game, join the raucous baseball crowd in Wrigley Field's bleachers, or plop down on a bar stool at the neighborhood tavern for whatever match is on TV.

Should the excitement rub off and inspire you to get active yourself, the city's 26 beaches and 580 parks offer a huge array of play options.\n\nRollicking Festivals\n\nChicago knows how to rock a festival. Between March and September it throws around 200 shindigs. The specialty is music.

During the four-day Lollapalooza megaparty, rock bands thrash while the audience dances in an arm-flailing frenzy. Smaller, barbecue-scented street fests take place in the neighborhoods each weekend – though some rival downtown for star power on their stages (oh, hey, Olivia Newton-John at Northalsted Market Days).","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/chicago"

"Madrid","Madrid, the capital of Spain, is a cosmopolitan city that combines the most modern infrastructures and the status as an economic, financial, administrative and service centre, with a large cultural and artistic heritage, a legacy of centuries of exciting history.\n\nStrategically located in the geographic centre of the Iberian Peninsula at an altitude of 646 m above sea level, Madrid has one of the most important historic centres of all the great European cities. This heritage merges seamlessly with the citys modern and convenient infrastructures, a wide-ranging offer of accommodation and services, and all the latest state-of-the-art technologies in audiovisual and communications media. These conditions, together with all the drive of a dynamic and open society –as well as high-spirited and friendly– have made this metropolis one of the great capitals of the Western world.\n\nIt has been populated since the Lower Palaeolithic era, although it was not until 1561 that King Philip II made Madrid the capital city of his vast empire. The historic centre, also known as the Madrid of Los Austrias (in reference to the Hapsburg monarchs), and the spectacular Plaza Mayor square –inaugurated in 1620 and one of the most popular and typical sites in Spain– are a living example of the nascent splendour of the city in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nNear the Plaza Mayor is the area known as the aristocratic centre where the jewel in the crown is the Royal Palace, an imposing building dating from the 17th century featuring a mixture of Baroque and classicist styles. Beside it is the Plaza de Oriente square, the Teatro Real opera house, and the modern cathedral of La Almudena which was consecrated in 1993 by Pope John Paul II. The Puerta del Sol square is surrounded by a varied and select area of shops and businesses, and the Paseo del Arte art route –whose name derives from its world-class museums, palaces and gardens– are further elements in an array of monuments which includes particularly the Bank of Spain building, the Palace of Telecommunications, and the fountains of Cibeles and Neptune.\n\nArt and culture play a key role in Madrids cultural life. The capital has over 60 museums which cover every field of human knowledge. Highlights include the Prado Museum, one of the worlds most important art galleries; the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, with over 800 paintings ranging from primitive Flemish artists through to the avant-garde movements. And the Reina Sofía National Art Centre, dedicated to contemporary Spanish art and containing works by Picasso, Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí and Juan Gris, among others.\n\nMadrids extensive and beautifully maintained parks and gardens –like the Retiro park, formerly the recreational estate to the Spanish monarchs, the Casa de Campo and the Juan Carlos I park– offer inhabitants and visitors the chance to enjoy the sunshine, stroll, row on its lakes or feed the squirrels, in one of the greenest capitals in Europe. The importance of its international airport, which every week receives over 1,000 flights from all over the world, its two Conference Centres, the modern trade fair ground in the Campo de las Naciones, and over 80,000 places in other meeting centres make Madrid one of Europes most attractive business hubs.\n\nBut if theres one thing that sets Madrid apart, it must be its deep and infectious passion for life that finds its outlet in the friendly and open character of its inhabitants. Concerts, exhibitions, ballets, a select theatrical offering, the latest film releases, the opportunity to enjoy a wide range of the best Spanish and international gastronomy, to savour the charms of its bars and taverns... all these are just a few of the leisure options on offer in Madrid. There is also a tempting array of shops and businesses featuring both traditional establishments and leading stores offering top brands and international labels.\n\nMadrids lively nightlife is another key attraction of Spains capital, due to its variety and the exciting atmosphere to be found in its bars, pubs, clubs and flamenco halls. Other daytime entertainment options include traditional outdoor dances, popular festivities and the San Isidro bullfighting festival, regarded as being the most important in the world.","https://www.spain.info/en/que-quieres/ciudades-pueblos/grandes-ciudades/madrid.html"

"Valencia","There are few cities like Valencia, able to harmoniously combine the remnants of its farthest past, dating to the year 138 BC, with the most innovative and avant-garde buildings from the new millennium.\n\nValencia is trade and culture, cinema, theatre, museums, magic, business. It is the centre of international and avant-garde design, and one of the most active cities in Europe regarding fairs and conferences.\n\nThanks to its location, Valencia has historically been Spain’s Mediterranean port and has that special charm of cities that are also seaports.

"Malaga","The Gibralfaro castle casts a watchful eye over this warm-hearted and lively city full of attractive sites such as the Alameda Principal avenue and the La Farola seafront promenade.\n\nIts status as the capital of the Costa del Sol has made it one of Spains foremost holiday destinations, thanks to its mild climate, its beaches and its outstanding offer of golf courses.\n\nPhoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans… over 2,000 years ago the most important Mediterranean civilisations found in Malaga an exceptional place in which to establish trade routes, thanks to the strategic location of its port.

This building is today the site of the Archaeological Museum, containing valuable pieces dating from Phoenician and Roman times.\n\nThe Gibralfaro castle (14th century) is linked to the Alcazaba by a section of wall and offers outstanding views over the city, which is open to the sea through its port and the La Farola seafront promenade, one of the citys main leisure areas.

"Murcia","A chain of mountains surrounds the plain which Murcia sits upon, a city of Arab origin whose existence is closely linked to the fertile lands around the river Segura. From among its streets of guilds emerges the tower of the Cathedral, one of the symbols of the city.\n\nAlthough the region of Murcia has been inhabited for more than 2,000 years, the city of Murcia was not founded until 831, when the Emir of Cordoba Abd ar-Rahman II commissioned a walled city on the banks of the river Segura, to be the provincial capital under the Caliphate.\n\nIt was then that the Moorish region of Mursiya started to gain importance, until it became part of the Kingdom of Castile in the 13th century. Today, many places in the city still evoke its Moorish past. The architectural remains of the Almunia Real, the second residence of the Moorish monarchs, are particularly interesting. The site is about five kilometres north of Murcia, and many items recovered there can be seen at the Santa Clara Museum. Parts of the Moorish city wall can also still be seen in different parts of Murcias historic quarter.\n\nThe old town is situated next to the river Segura, with historical streets which still bear the names of the guilds that used to work there, such as the shopping streets Calle Platería, Calle Trapería, and Calle Vidrieros (silversmiths, cloth merchants and glass workers, respectively).\n\nIn Plaza Cardenal Belluga there are two architectural gems - the Episcopal Palace (18th century), with a rococo façade and Churrigueresque patio, and the Cathedral, begun in the late 14th century, and notable for its combination of different styles. For example, the lavish sculptures of the Baroque façade are particularly striking, and the impressive tower next to it is 92 metres high. Inside, the Vélez Chapel is a magnificent example of Flamboyant Gothic.\n\nMurcian Baroque is widely represented by religious buildings, such as the Church of La Merced, originating from the 16th century and rebuilt in the 18th century, the Convent Church of Santa Ana, and the Churches of Santo Domingo, San Nicolás and San Miguel.\n\nSome of the most important 19th-century buildings are also worth visiting: the Town Hall, the Roman Theatre and the Casino, this last with a Neoclassical façade and beautiful interior courtyard with Moorish influence.\n\nThe neighbourhoods of San Pedro, Santa Catalina and the surrounding area of the Plaza de las Flores offer some of the most picturesque corners of the capital of Murcia. A tour of the city could end in the beautiful Paseo del Malecón, the former embankment which once linked the city to the market gardens around it.\n\nMurcia has a broad range of museums and exhibitions. The Cathedral Museum boasts a spectacular processional monstrance from Toledo, while the Salzillo Museum has a beautiful collection of processional sculptures by this artist, one of the most iconic sculptors of 18th-century Spain. The Murcia Archaeological Museum conserves items from the different cultures that have come and gone in the region, including the Tesoro de la Finca Pinta, a hoard of Moorish and Christian coins. The Fine Arts Museum displays works by Giordano and Madrazo, amongst others.\n\nOther museums of interest are the Santa Clara Museum, the Museum of the City, the San Juan de Dios Museum, the Science and Water Museum, the Water Mills Museum, the Craft Centre and the Bullfighting Museum.\n\nFiestas, local cuisine and surrounding areas. \n\nThe city of Murcia has many religious and secular festivals, and its Easter celebrations are particularly notable. The salzillos procession, held on Good Friday, is well worth seeing. Also outstanding is the Entierro de la Sardina (burial of the sardine), part of its Spring Festival, which includes a parade. Both events have been declared Festivals of International Tourist Interest.\n\nOne of the capitals most deeply-rooted traditions is probably the Bando de la Huerta, which is also a Festival of International Tourist Interest and has been celebrated every Holy Tuesday for over a century and a half. This fiesta celebrates the regions traditional food and folklore, with parades, regional costumes, tastings of local specialities and reading of verses in Panocho, a local dialect. Another popular festivity is the Romería de la Virgen de la Fuensanta, where a procession takes a figure of the Virgin from the cathedral to a shrine five kilometres from Murcia.\n\nThe local cuisine of Murcia is based on the excellent fruit and vegetables grown in the region. The local specialities made with these raw materials include pisto huertano (similar to ratatouille, with peppers, onion and tomato), chickpeas with Swiss chard, and zarangollo (courgette, egg and onion). And to accompany our meal, we can choose any of the Murcia wines with Designation of Origin: Bullas, Yecla and Jumilla.\n\nOne of the main tourist attractions in Murcia is the coast, known as the Costa Cálida. Its 250 kilometres of coast, including the Mar Menor lagoon and the Mediterranean, provide a multitude of beaches offering a wide variety of water sports: sailing, windsurfing, kayaking, water-skiing, diving, etc. Águilas and Mazarrón have some of Spains best areas for scuba diving, with clear water and high visibility, where you can get close to the aquatic flora and fauna, and youll often see the remains of shipwrecks. Cartagena is another town with plenty to offer holidaymakers, from its coastline to its heritage buildings, and the fascinating National Museum of Underwater Archaeology.\n\nLa Manga del Mar Menor is very close to the town of Cartagena and is one of the main tourist destinations on the Costa Cálida. This area is unusual because it is a narrow strip of land running for some 24 kilometres (from La Punta del Mojón to Cabo de Palos), dividing the great lagoon of Mar Menor from the Mediterranean Sea. If you like water sports, here you will find a full range of facilities and services at the Marine Resort, where you can hire equipment, sign up for courses and book accommodation. La Manga del Mar Menor also has a reputation as a natural spa and beauty centre, thanks to the excellent therapeutic properties of its renowned marine mud.\n\nInland there are historical towns such as Caravaca de la Cruz and Lorca. Lorca is particularly attractive for its many Baroque buildings - parish churches, convents, mansions and palaces. San Patricio Collegiate Church and Lorca Castle are National Monuments. A few kilometres from this town is the Parador de Puerto Lumbreras, halfway between Levante and Andalusia, an exceptional place to stay if you want to visit these regions.\n\nThe province of Murcia has a wealth of landscape and environmental heritage, protected by regional parks. Golden sand beaches, with dunes and unspoilt coves can be found in Salinas y Arenales de San Pedro del Pinatar; Calblanque, Monte de las Cenizas y Peña del Águila; and Cabo Cope y Puntas de Calnegre. The mountain ranges and valleys inland are the main features of the regional parks of Sierra de Carche, Sierra de la Pila, Sierra de Espuña, and Carrascoy y El Valle. These places are the perfect setting for sports with a low impact on the environment and for exploring nature in Murcia.","https://www.spain.info/en/que-quieres/ciudades-pueblos/otros-destinos/murcia.html"

It was shortlisted for the European Commissions EDEN programme (European Destinations of Excellence), in recognition of its commitment to sustainable tourism. La Palma, known as the isla bonita (beautiful island), is the greenest island in the Canary Island archipelago. From lush forests to steep cliffs hiding beaches of black sand, visitors will find the island endlessly surprising for its ecological treasures and exceptional scenery. Declared a Biosphere Reserve by the UNESCO, it is home to numerous protected natural spaces, including the Caldera de Taburiente National Park inland. The volcanic lava, which goes right down to the sea, has created a low, rocky coastline with small bays hidden away between steep cliffs.\n\nThe nature of the terrain means that only a few kilometres inland there are high mountain ranges such as the Roque de los Muchachos, a world reference for astrophysics thanks to its modern observatory which has one of the most cutting-edge and spectacular telescopes in the world. With annual temperatures of between 16 and 21 degrees centigrade, La Palma has numerous interesting monuments and archaeological sites, as well as a multitude of shrines, churches and museums –although perhaps its most outstanding historic feature is the town of Santa Cruz de la Palma. Some of its most deeply-rooted traditions are worth a particular mention, including Los Indianos at carnival time and every five years, the quinquennial festivities known as the Descent of the Virgin of Las Nieves. In the first two weeks of July, the festivities of the Semana Grande and the Semana Chica are a chance to enjoy a series of major events and performances. A particular highlight is the Dance of the Dwarves.\n\nHand-crafted textiles, cigars, sweets and traditionally-made cheeses are just a few of the wide variety of items on offer in the island."
"Pequim","From ancient walled capital to showpiece megacity in barely a century, Beijing (Běijīng, 北京), spins a breathless yarn of triumph, tragedy, endurance and innovation.\n\n\n\nLayers of History\n\nCapital of China since Kublai Khan came a-knocking (with a hundred thousand Mongol horsemen behind him), Beijing has hosted the last three imperial dynasties: the Yuan (Mongols), the Ming (Han Chinese) and the Qing (Manchu). Hutong, the city's residential alleyways, are a Mongolian legacy. The Forbidden City? Hat-tip to the Ming. Summer Palace? The Qing. Nor does it stop there. Chairman Mao slumbers in Tian'anmen Square, hallowed turf for the Communist Party of China. And over it all loom giants like the 528m CITIC Tower, which topped out in 2018. What next for this restive superpower? You're about to find out...\n\nHave You Eaten?\n\nIn Beijing, chī le ma? (have you eaten?) is literally how locals greet their neighbours. Food is the glue that binds all Beijingren, no matter their beliefs or bank balance. Whether you're slurping noodles, queuing for jiānbing, or guiltily rolling just one more Peking duck pancake, you're in good company. A mouth-watering melting pot, Beijing hosts exotic regional cuisines from across China, which equates to unbridled adventure for foodies. And all that icky stuff: dogs, snakes, bugs? That’s all down south. Beijingren don't go in for any of that tripe. Although they do love actual tripe, dipped in sesame sauce!\n\nState of the Arts\n\nFrom Peking opera troupes to world-class contemporary art, Beijing draws on a profound well of creativity, and that's despite the vagaries of censorship. To give the government its due, museums are more numerous than ever, curation is less prescriptive and innovation is at an all-time high. China's finest universities feed Zhongguancun, the 'Silicon Valley' of Beijing, which is making seismic waves with its breakthroughs in AI and Big Data. At the humbler end, post-punk bands drone away in divey livehouses, local DJs get the hands in the air, while old folks still warble the revolutionary songs in the city parks.\n\n\n\nParty Capital\n\nUndisputed party capital – the Communist Party, that is – Beijing is a uniquely micromanaged megacity, a showpiece where the State's latest schemes are piloted to the populace. 'Xi Jinping Thought' is the guiding mantra (Xi being China's prez for the foreseeable future). When Beijing needs to get things done, it gets things done. Air pollution? Improving year on year. Winter Olympics in a snowless city? No problemo. Country-wide surveillance? Easy-peasy. The world's biggest airport, Daxing, was ready to open at time of research, as ever more bullet trains race outwards to the provinces. All in a day's work for Beijing.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/beijing"
"Shanghai","Shanghai: few cities in the world evoke so much history, excess, glamour, mystique and exotic promise in name alone.\n\nShanghai is home to the worlds second-tallest tower and a host of other neck-craning colossi. But its not all sky-scraping razzmatazz. Beyond the crisply cool veneer of the modern city typified by Pudong, you can encounter copious architectural styles. The citys period of greatest cosmopolitan excess – the 1920s and 1930s – left the city with splendid examples of art deco buildings, most of which survived the vicissitudes of the 20th century. And theres more: from Jesuit cathedrals, Jewish synagogues and Buddhist temples to home-grown lòngtáng (laneway) and shíkùmén (stone gate) housing, Shanghai’s diverse architectural heritage is like no other citys on earth.\n\nThirty years ago, Shanghais dour restaurant scene was all tin trays and scowling wait staff, with international food confined to exclusive hotels. Today, the seriously good restaurant scene is varied, exciting and up-to-the-minute. Shanghai got its own Michelin dining guide in 2017, proving just how far the city has come. Food is the hub of Chinese social life, and its while eating that people catch up, celebrate and clinch business deals. Inevitably, some of your best memories here will be culinary. Do as the Shanghainese do and make a meal of it.\n\nBearing in mind that Chinese shoppers constitute up to 46% of the global luxury-goods market, shopping is rarely done in half-measures in Shanghai. Retail therapy is one way of spending new money and the Shanghainese arent called 小资 (xiǎozī – little capitalists) by the rest of China for nothing, especially at the luxury end of things. But its not all Prada, Gucci and Burberry. There are pop-up boutiques, bustling markets, cool vintage shops and young designer outlets. Beyond clothing, youre spoiled for choice, whether youre in the market for antiques, ceramics, art, jewellery… whatever is on your shopping list.\n\nBeijing often hogs the limelight as China’s cultural nexus, but for a town of wheelers and dealers, Shanghai is surprisingly creative. Many art galleries are exciting, offering a window into contemporary Chinese concerns, while nightlife options have exploded. Acrobatics shows are always a tourist favourite and you might grab the chance to catch some Chinese opera. Shanghai’s music and club scenes are vibrant: from unpretentious jazz and indie venues to all-night hip-hop and electro-dance parties, the city swings with the best of them.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/shanghai"
"Xian","Once the terminus of the Silk Road and a melting pot of cultures and religions, as well as home to emperors, courtesans, poets, monks, merchants and warriors, the glory days of Xian (西安, Xī’ān; pronounced see-an) may have ended in the early 10th century, but a considerable amount of ancient Chang’an, the former city, survives behind the often roaring, modern city. Xian’s Ming-era city walls remain intact, vendors of all descriptions still crowd the narrow lanes of the warren-like Muslim Quarter, and there are enough places of interest to keep even the most amateur historian riveted.\n\nMost people only spend two or three days in Xian; dynastic enthusiasts could easily stay busy for a week. Must-sees include the Army of Terracotta Warriors, the Tomb of Emperor Jingdi, Xian City Walls and the Muslim Quarter, but try to set aside time for its pagodas and museums, plus a side trip to nearby Hua Shan.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/shaanxi-shanxi/xian"
"Guilin","Guangxis second-largest city, Guilin (桂林, Guìlín) has the hallmarks of most Chinese megapolises, but it feels much more relaxed given its spectacular setting among the jagged-peak limestone karsts that surround it. It was Chinas first city to develop tourism after 1949, and for decades, childrens textbooks proclaimed Guilins landscape is the best under heaven (桂林山水甲天下). It was the darling of Chinese politicians, the star city proudly presented to visiting dignitaries. Today Guilins natural endowments still amaze, yet, thanks to imperfect urban planning, there is a pervasive feeling that the city is past its prime.\n\nGuilin serves as a convenient base to plan trips to the rest of the province. Its clean, modern and offers plenty of greenery among its city lakes and the majestic Li River. Star Wars fans may recognise the surrounding karst peaks from Revenge of Sith, which was used as the set location for the Wookiee planet, Kashyyyk.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/guangxi/guilin"
"Chengdu","Chengdu (成都, Chéngdū) is no great draw when it comes to major tourist sites, but yet this is one of the few super-sized Chinese cities that most visitors do end up enjoying. Theres a relaxing teahouse culture – favourite local institutions have been serving the same brews for generations; a lively nightlife that mixes craft beer bars and super-hip clubs with Sichuan opera shows; and delicious food that is famous for its heat, history and variety even in cuisine-rich China, and very much a point of pride: Chengdu is, after all, Unescos first-ever City of Gastronomy. Oh, and as if thats not enough, this is the place to come to see Chinas cutest faces – the giant pandas.\n\nChengdu is the transport hub for the entire region and most travellers in Chinas southwest pass through this way at some point. Just make sure you dont rush your visit.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/sichuan/chengdu"
"Shenzhen","The gleaming manifestation of Chinas economic miracle, Shēnzhèn (深圳) has risen from the marshy Pearl River Delta into one of the worlds most mega megacities in less time than it took Londons St Pauls Cathedral to be built. Millions of migrants have been drawn to its golden gates from the Chinese countryside since the 1980s; now, Shēnzhèn attracts high-flying tech graduates and global corporations.\n\nBut its not all work, work, work. This free-spirited, forward-looking metropolis has thriving arts, nightlife and music scenes, multicultural dining and oodles of shopping. And when you step away from the skyscrapers and malls youll discover fascinating urban villages, poor but vibrant migrant worker communities that were once clan villages before the city swallowed them up.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/guangdong/shenzhen"
"Wuhan","Wuhan (武汉; Wǔhàn) has matured from the sprawling convergence of three independent cities to central Chinas main industrial and commercial centre. While theres not much in the way of cultural sites, Wuhan is a major transport hub so you may find yourself here for a night or two.\n\nThe Yangzi and Han rivers open up the densely packed streets, flowing by parks, lakes and a concession-era entertainment district in Hankou, the pick of the three former cities. This is not a place of penny postcards, but for those travelling through the middle of the Middle Kingdom, its a good place to get your urban fix.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/hubei/wuhan"
"Dongguan","Dongguan is a city that’s bursting with life, vigor and passion. The city might seem like an unorthodox choice for a touristy vacation. Let this not deter you though, as it’s a welcome surprise to know that Dongguan holds an award for the “The National Excellence in Tourism” in China. Let’s delve into its tourist and historical locations for a moment. Dongguan offers its travelers and locals the true essence of Chinese history as it is home to Humen Bridge and the Opium War Museum. The attraction factors don’t end there. The city is also dubbed as an ecological tourist location, thanks to the natural settings of Yufeng Garden and Qifeng Park in its midst.\n\nIf food is your deal, you’ll love Dongguan for the foodie pleasures it has to offer you and your rumbling tummy. There are the petite samplings of local food ready to be grabbed at the snack-bars on Houjie Street. Seafood holds much fame here too, with delicious crustaceans to shuck into, such as green crabs, greasy-back shrimp and Mantis shrimp, all prepared in true Dongguan style. Last, but not at all least, is the vivacious nightlife activity that beckons to the hearts of even the most weary and unimpassioned traveller.\n\nRead on to discover the things to do in Dongguan here!","https://trip101.com/article/best-things-to-do-in-dongguan-china"
"Guangzhou","Guǎngzhōu (广州), once better known internationally as Canton, has been Chinas busiest trading centre for centuries. Despite breakneck redevelopment up to and after the 2010 Asian Games, much of the metropolis still hums along at a pleasantly sedate pace, where narrow, leafy streets conceal temples and mosques, pockets of colonial-era heritage, traditional dim-sum eateries, distinctive qílóu shophouses and Lǐngnán architecture. Equally, you can embrace modernity via the 21st-century architectural landmarks of the showpiece Zhūjiāng New Town, such as the late Zaha Hadids Opera House and the slim-waisted Canton Tower, rising up over the Pearl River, which cuts a lazy swathe through the city.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/guangdong/guangzhou"
"Tiajin","Forever being compared to Běijīng (if anything, its more like Shànghǎi), the former foreign concession port of Tiānjīn (天津) is a large, booming, yet laid-back city, with a pleasant river promenade and some charming, European-flavoured neighbourhoods. Its an easy day trip from the capital, but you may want a long weekend to explore the city properly.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/tianjin"
"Rome","The Province of Rome is a matching frame for the many treasures of the Capital, and the surrounding area has, more or less directly, experienced the influence of the history of the Eternal City.The Region of Lazio offers everything from sea and nature to good food and lovely villages rich in history and art. And around Rome, the hills, lakes, rivers and vineyards make for a kaleidoscope of diversity and attractions for nature lovers.
Facing the Tyrrhenian Sea, The Province enjoys a Mediterranean climate on the coast and a continental one further inland. The coast stretches from the area including Fiumicino and the towns overlooking Lake Bracciano (the largest in the province) to the border with the Province of Latina.\n\nIn the northwest are the Tolfa and Sabatini Mountains, along with the nature reserves of Macchiagrande, Macchiatonda, Torre Flavia and Canale Monterano. In the Tiber Valley lie the Park of Valle del Treja, and the nature reserves of Nazzano-Tevere-Farfa and of Mount Soratte.\n\nThe Tiburtino-Sublacense area, crossed by the River Aniene, includes the regional parks of the Lucretili and Simbruini Mountains. The territory that comprises the Prenestina area and the Lepini Mountains is nestled between the Aniene Valley and the Albani Hills. The volcanic Lakes of Nemi and Albano characterize the Castelli Romani area - a holiday resort since ancient times - thanks to the mild climate and the gentle landscape.\n\nEven before becoming the Capital of the Italian Republic, Rome had always played a key role, in Italy as well as in Europe. Caput Mundi in Roman times and later seat of the papacy and the Capital of the Kingdom of Italy, on an international level Rome has always been a major political, cultural and spiritual influence.

"Milan","Looking for a city where to spend your holidays which can satisfy all your needs? Milan, Italy, is the perfect destination of you next trip. I gained for the first time Milan a couple of years ago and I remained very impressed by the vivid and young spirit of this international city.\n\nIf you love European cities’ nightlife, if you like to make shopping and buy just fashion dresses, if you want to fully live your city time and go out with friends to have a happy hour break there is no other place in Italy better than Milan. You can take a walk around the very famous “Quadrilatero della Moda”, in downtown Milan, four streets where are concentrated all the best and most loved brands and shops of planet Earth.\n\nAfter shopping you can go on walking towards the beautiful Piazza del Duomo, where you can relax having a lunch break in one of the many cafès located in the wonderful Galleria Vittorio Emanuele. If you love art, Milan is a perfect destination to spend some time: in Milan you can often find some of the best expositions Italy also because of the vibrant spirit of a city hometown of many young artists especially active in the fields of photography and design.\n\nPalazzo Reale is one of the best art museums in Milan and inside it you can find some of the most important expositions which every year animate the City.","http://www.visititaly.com/holiday/milan.aspx"
"Naples","Naples is raw, high-octane energy, a place of soul-stirring art and panoramas, spontaneous conversations and unexpected, inimitable elegance. Welcome to Italys most unlikely masterpiece.\n\nArt & ArchitectureNaples wealth of cultural assets is extraordinary. Youll find two royal palaces, three castles, and ancient ruins that include some of Christianitys oldest frescoes. The citys Museo Archeologico Nazionale claims the worlds finest collection of Pompeiian frescoes and mosaics, while its Cappella Sansevero holds Italys most extraordinary marble sculpture. Youll find Caravaggio masterpieces in the Pio Monte della Misericordia, Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano and Museo di Capodimonte, the latter palace home to countless masterpieces. Of course, we could also mention all those frescoed baroque cupolas, but that would just be boasting.\n\nHistory & LegendNaples millennia-old backstory could bust a bookshelf. Settled by the Greeks and conquered by the Romans, its a nail-biting tale where myth and fact entwine into one bewitching whole. Did Queen Joan II really throw her lovers to a peckish crocodile in the Castel Nuovo? Do the skulls inside the Cimitero delle Fontanelle have esoteric powers? And just how did alchemist prince Raimondo di Sangro create those inexplicably perfect arterial systems inside his Cappella Sansevero? Curious tales and unsolved mysteries seep out of every Neapolitan stone, casting a strange, hypnotic spell.\n\nGlorious Food\nBlessed with rich volcanic soils, a bountiful sea, and countless generations of culinary know-how, the Naples region is one of Italys epicurean heavyweights. Its here that youll find the countrys best pizza, pasta and espresso, its most appetising street markets, not to mention some of its most celebrated dishes. From garlicky spaghetti alle vongole (spaghetti with clams) to sultry ragù (meat and tomato sauce) and silky parmigiana di melanzane (eggplant parmigiana), the food on these streets is all about intensity and pleasure. After all, life is too short for diets, so follow the locals lead and succumb to your gluttonous whims.\n\nIdiosyncratic Shopping\nIn Naples, retail therapy is as individualistic as the city itself. Here, global chains still play second fiddle to family-run businesses and artisan workshops. Neapolitan tailors have long lured foreign dandies with their impeccable suits, shirts and ties, while the citys handmade leather gloves are sought by the global fashion royalty. Skinny streets and weathered courtyards are dotted with a plethora of workshops and boutiques, selling everything from butter-soft satchels, organic ceramics and meticulous pastori (nativity-scene figurines), to rare Neapolitan lithographs and gourmet local food and wine. Leave plenty of room in your suitcase.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/campania/naples"
"Genoa","Italys largest sea port is indefatigably contradictory, full at once of grandeur, squalor, sparkling light and deep shade. Its a gateway to the Riviera for many travellers today, but a weighty architectural heritage speaks of its former glory – the Most Serene Republic of Genoa ruled over the Mediterranean waves during the 12th to the 13th centuries – and history feels alive in Genoa. No more is this true than in its extensive old city, an often confronting reminder of premodern life with its twisting maze of caruggi (narrow streets), largely intact. Emerge blinking from this thrillingly dank heart to Via Garibaldi and the splendid Enlightenment-era gold-leaf halls of the Unesco-listed Palazzi dei Rolli.\n\nThe citys once-tatty port area now hosts museums and a number of eating and drinking options. Its old town, too, has had its own far more organic revitalisation, with a bright new crop of fashionable shops, restaurants and bars lighting the way.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/liguria-piedmont-and-valle-daosta/genoa"
"Bologna","Fusing haughty elegance with down-to-earth grit in one beautifully colonnaded medieval grid, Bologna is a city of two intriguing halves. One side is a hard-working, high-tech city located in the super-rich Po valley where suave opera-goers waltz out of regal theatres and into some of the nations finest restaurants. The other is a bolshie, politically edgy city that hosts the worlds oldest university and is famous for its graffiti-embellished piazzas filled with mildly inebriated students swapping Gothic fashion tips.\n\nNo small wonder Bologna has earned so many historical monikers. La Grassa (the fat one) celebrates a rich food legacy (ragù or bolognese sauce was first concocted here). La Dotta (the learned one) doffs a cap to the city university founded in 1088. La Rossa (the red one) alludes to the ubiquity of the terracotta medieval buildings adorned with miles of porticoes, as well as the citys long-standing penchant for left-wing politics.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/emilia-romagna-and-san-marino/bologna"
"Florence","Cradle of the Renaissance, romantic, enchanting and utterly irresistible, Florence (Firenze) is a place to feast on world-class art and gourmet Tuscan cuisine.\n\nArt & Architecture. \n\nFew cities are so compact in size or so packed with extraordinary art and architecture masterpieces at every turn. The urban fabric of this small city, on the banks of the Arno river in northeastern Tuscany, has hardly changed since the Renaissance and its narrow cobbled streets are a cinematic feast of elegant 15th- and 16th-century palazzi (palaces), medieval candle-lit chapels, fresco-decorated churches, marble basilicas and world-class art museums brimming with paintings and sculptures by Botticcelli, Michelangelo et al. Unsurprisingly, the entire city centre is a Unesco World Heritage Site.\n\nBoutique Shopping\n\nItalys fashion industry was born and bred here. Homegrown designers Guccio Gucci and Salvatore Ferragamo opened haute-couture boutiques in Florence in the 1920s and shopping in the Tuscan capital has been stylish ever since. A-lister fashion houses lace Via de Tornabuoni and a Pandoras box of specialist boutiques selling all manner of beautiful objects parade alongside family-run botteghe (workshops) in a glorious tangle of medieval backstreets. Watch fourth-generation Florentine goldsmiths and shoemakers at work, buy artisan scents evocative of the Florentine countryside and Tuscan sea breeze, and know the tag Fiorentina is one of the finest international labels going.\n\nFood & Wine\n\nQuality produce sourced locally, seasonally and sustainably is the holy trinity and Florentines share an enormous pride in their culinary tradition. Their city, surrounded by wine-rich hills, is a gourmet paradise where eating and drinking exceedingly well is mandatory. Be it a traditional bowl of earthy ribollita (bean, bread and veg soup), a tripe panino at a family-run food truck or a blue T-bone steak served in a market trattoria unchanged since 1915, dining in Florence is timeless and memorable. Raw cuisine, fish bistros, craft cocktails and the dazzling creativity of modern young Tuscan chefs add contemporary edge.\n\nLa Dolce Vita\n\nStand on a bridge over the Arno several times in a day and the light and mood changes every time. At sunset hike to Piazzale Michelangelo to be dazzled by a palette embracing every known shade of soft pink, orange and fiery amber. Surprisingly small as it is, Florence looms large on the worlds must-sees list – and not just for its unmatched treasure chest of art. Rich in culture, backdropped by history and anchored by family, faith and food, the Florentine lifestyle is enviably sweet. Enjoy a go-slow afternoon passeggiata, indulge in an aperitivo at dusk, savour la dolce vita…,"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/florence" 
"Catania","For all the noise, chaos and scruffiness that hit the visitor at first glance, Catania has a strong magnetic pull. This is Sicily at its most youthful, a city packed with cool and gritty bars, abundant energy and an earthy spirit in sharp contrast to Palermo’s aristocratic airs.\n\nCatania’s historic core is a Unesco-listed wonder, where black-and-white palazzi tower over sweeping baroque piazzas. One minute you’re scanning the skyline from a dizzying dome, the next perusing contemporary art in an 18th-century convent. Beneath it all are the ancient ruins of a town with over 2700 candles on its birthday cake. Indeed, food is another local forte. This is the home of Sicilys iconic pasta alla Norma and the extraordinary La Pescheria market.\n\nKeeping an eye on it all is Catanias skyscraping frenemy, Mt Etna, a powerful presence that adds another layer of intensity and beauty to Sicilys second-biggest city.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/sicily/catania"
"Bari","If Lecce is the south’s Florence, Bari is its Bologna, a historic but forward-looking town with a high percentage of young people and migrants lending it vigour. More urban than Lecce and Brindisi, with grander boulevards and better nightlife, Bari supports a large university, an opera house and municipal buildings that shout confidence.\n\nMost travellers skip Bari on their way to Puglia’s big-hitter, Lecce (the towns have a long-standing rivalry, especially over soccer), but Bari doesn’t lack history or culture. The old town contains the bones of St Nicholas (aka Santa Claus) in its Basilica di San Nicola, and an excellent archaeological museum is concealed in Baris historic bastions. For travelling foodies, theres superb seafood and a bustling street food scene.\n\nThe second-largest town in southern Italy, Bari is a busy port with connections to Greece, Albania and Croatia, and sports an international airport with connections to much of Europe.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/puglia/bari"
"Turin","Theres a whiff of Paris in Turins elegant tree-lined boulevards and echoes of Vienna in its stately art-nouveau cafes, but make no mistake – this elegant, Alp-fringed city is utterly self-possessed. The industrious Torinese gave the world its first saleable hard chocolate and Italys most iconic car, the Fiat.\n\nIts booming contemporary art, architecture and live-music scene and innovative food and wine culture are definitely aspects youll want to discover.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/lombardia/turin"
"Istanbul","This magical meeting place of East and West has more top-drawer attractions than it has minarets (and thats a lot).\n\nLiving History\n\nİstanbuls strategic location has attracted many marauding armies over the centuries. The Greeks, Romans and Venetians took turns ruling before the Ottomans stormed into town and decided to stay – physical reminders of their various tenures are found across the city. The fact that the city straddles two continents wasnt its only drawcard – it was the final stage on the legendary Silk Road linking Asia with Europe, and many merchants who came here liked it so much that they, too, decided to stay. In so doing, they gave the city a cultural diversity that it retains to this day.\n\nArt & Architecture\n\nThe conquering armies of ancient times tended to ransack the city rather than endow it with artistic treasures, but all that changed with the Byzantines, who adorned their churches and palaces with mosaics and frescoes. Miraculously, many of these remain. Their successors, the Ottomans, were quick to launch an ambitious building program and the magnificently decorated imperial mosques that resulted are architectural triumphs that together form one of the worlds great skylines. In recent years, local banks and business dynasties have reprised the Ottomans grand ambitions and endowed an impressive array of galleries, museums and festivals for all to enjoy.\n\nCulinary Heritage\n\nBut what about the food? we hear you say. Were happy to report that the citys cuisine is as diverse as its heritage, and delicious to boot. Locals take their eating and drinking seriously – the restaurants here are the best in the country. You can eat aromatic Asian dishes or Italian classics if you so choose, but most visitors prefer to sample the succulent kebaps, flavoursome mezes and freshly caught fish that are the citys signature dishes, washing them down with the national drink, rakı (aniseed brandy), or a glass or two of locally produced wine.\n\nLocal Life\n\nSome ancient cities are the sum of their monuments, but İstanbul factors a lot more into the equation. Chief among its manifold attractions are the locals, who have an infectious love of life and generosity of spirit. This vibrant, inclusive and expanding community is full of people who work and party hard, treasure family and friendships, and have no problem melding tradition and modernity in their everyday lives. Joining them in their favourite haunts – çay bahçesis (tea gardens), kahvehans (coffeehouses), meyhanes (Turkish taverns) and kebapçıs (kebap restaurants) – will be a highlight of your visit.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/istanbul"
"Ankara","Turkeys other city may not have showy Ottoman palaces or regal facades, but Ankara thrums to a vivacious, youthful beat unmarred by the tug of history. Drawing comparisons with İstanbul is pointless – the flat, modest surroundings are hardly the stuff of national poetry – but the civic success of this dynamic city is assured thanks to student panache and foreign-embassy intrigue.\n\nThe countrys capital has made remarkable progress from a dusty Anatolian backwater to todays sophisticated arena for international affairs. Turkeys economic success is reflected in the booming restaurant scene around Kavaklıdere and the ripped-jean politik of Kızılays sidewalk cafes, frequented by hip students, old-timers and businessmen alike. And while the vibrant street life is enough of a reason to visit, Ankara also boasts two extraordinary monuments central to the Turkish story – the beautifully conceived Museum of Anatolian Civilisations and the Anıt Kabir, a colossal tribute to Atatürk, modern Turkeys founder.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/central-anatolia/ankara"
"Ismir","Turkeys third-largest city is proudly liberal and deeply cultured. Garlanded around the azure-blue Bay of İzmir, it has been an important Aegean port since ancient times, when it was the Greek city of Smyrna, and its seafront kordon (promenade) is as fetching and lively as any in the world.\n\nThe citys rich and fascinating heritage ,reflects the fact that it has been the home of Greeks, Armenians, Jews, Levantines and Turks over the centuries. While not as multicultural these days, it still has resident Jewish and Levantine communities and its unique and delicious cuisine attests to this.\n\nForeign ,visitors here are largely limited to business travellers and tourists en route to Ephesus. The reason for this is a mystery to us, as the city is home to compelling attractions including one of Turkeys most fascinating bazaars, an impressive museum of history and art, and a local lifestyle as laid-back as it is welcoming.\n\n","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/aegean-coast/izmir"
"Bursa","Modern, industrial Bursa is built around the mosques, mausoleums and other sites from its incarnation as first Ottoman capital. Despite being built-up and somewhat chaotic, its durable Ottoman core and abundant parks keep it remarkably placid in places. For some fresh air after pounding the markets, the soaring peaks of Mt Uludağ (Turkeys premier ski resort) are nearby, with Çekirges thermal hamams en route.\n\nBursa was awarded Unesco World Heritage status in 2014 for being the birthplace of the Ottoman Empire. The citys historic contributions to Islamic development have given it an austere reputation. Yet locals are kind and welcoming, and you can take the occasional photo inside historic religious structures (just be respectful). Youll see a majority of headscarved women here and devout prayer in overflowing mosques.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/bursa"
"Adana","Despite a pedigree stretching to the ancient Hittites and beyond, Adana is an energetic, modern place with just a handful of sights, some pretty good cafes and bars and excellent transport links. Turkeys fourth-largest city makes a good base for exploring the little-visited historic sites and ruins to the southwest, and if youve been travelling lazily along the Med, the urban buzz may be just the city-slicker injection you need.\n\nThe city is more or less cut in two by the D400 highway. North of the road (called Turan Cemal Beriker Bulvarı in town and running west to east and over Kennedy Bridge) are leafy and well-heeled districts. South of the trendy high-rise apartments and pavement bars and cafes, things get more cluttered and housing starts to sprawl. The Seyhan River delimits the city centre to the east.\n\n","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/adana"
"Gaziantep","Theres one Turkish word you should learn before visiting Gaziantep: fıstık (pistachio). This fast-paced and epicurean city has around 180 pastry shops producing the worlds best pistachio baklava. Other culinary treats are also on offer for adventurous foodie travellers.\n\nWith the biggest city park this side of the Euphrates and a buzzing cafe culture, Gaziantep oozes panache and self-confidence. It also has one astounding attraction definitely worth travelling across Turkey for – the superb Gaziantep Zeugma Mosaic Museum.\n\nThe older parts of the city are being reinvigorated, and the fortress, bazaars, caravanserai and old stone houses have been lovingly restored.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/central-anatolia/gaziantep-antep"
"Konya","An economic powerhouse that is religiously inspired and a busy university city thats as conservative as they come: Konya treads a delicate path between its historical significance as the home town of the whirling dervish orders and a bastion of Seljuk culture, and its modern importance as an economic boom town. The city derives considerable charm from this juxtaposition of old and new. Ancient mosques and the maze-like market district rub up against contemporary Konya around Alaaddin Tepesi, where hip-looking university students talk religion and politics in the tea gardens. If you are passing through this region, say from the coast to Cappadocia, then make time to explore one of Turkeys most compelling cities.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/central-anatolia/konya"
"Bagcilar","Bagcilar district is close to Kucukcekmece, Bakirkoy, and Bahcelievler. It is located on the European side of the city. Originally the Balkan Turks and the Greek Turks had been placed here. In the 90s, works started on the areas infrastructure. With time, more and more big companies came to this area for their factories, workshops, attracting population from Istanbul as well as other parts of Turkey, and increasing the demand for housing.","https://www.turkeyexpert.com/Istanbul/Bagcilar-basin-express-highway?p=9"
"Antalya","Once seen simply as the gateway to the Turkish Riviera, Antalya today is very much a destination in its own right. Situated right on the Gulf of Antalya (Antalya Körfezi), the largest city on Turkeys western Mediterranean coastline is both classically beautiful and stylishly modern. At its core is the wonderfully preserved old-city district of Kaleiçi (literally within the castle), which offers atmospheric accommodation in the finely restored Ottoman houses on its winding lanes. The old city wraps around a splendid Roman-era harbour with clifftop views of hazy-blue mountain silhouettes that are worth raising a toast to. Just outside of the central city are two beaches and one of Turkeys finest museums","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/mediterranean-coast/antalya"
"Cankaya","Places to Visit in Cankaya\n\nAbout to jet off on your Cankaya holiday? Dont know what sort of things to include in your travel itinerary? Dont worry — were here to give you some hints.\n\nIf the young ones have had enough of sightseeing and need a bit of exercise, why not take them to Kugulu Park? Its the perfect spot to have a running race and toss a ball around. Adventurers have heaps of options in and around this destination. Would you like to while away an afternoon among the trees? Make your way to Botanik Park. Still have some time to spare? Grab some sandwiches, fruit and cool drinks and indulge in a picnic at Segmenler Park.

"Hong Kong","Hong Kong welcomes with an iconic skyline, a legendary kitchen, and lush, protected nature where rare birds and colourful traditions thrive.\n\nNeighbourhoods & Islands\n\nHong Kongs enchanting neighbourhoods and islands offer a sensory feast. You may find yourself swaying along on a historic double-decker tram, cheering with the hordes at the city-centre horse races, or simply gazing out at the glorious harbour. What most visitors dont immediately realise is that over 70% of Hong Kong is mountains and sprawling country parks, some also home to geological and historical gems. Escape the city limits on one of the world’s smoothest transport systems and spend your day wandering in a Song dynasty village, hiking on a deserted island or kayaking among volcanic sea arches.\n\nCuisine\n\nOne of the worlds top culinary capitals, the city that worships the God of Cookery has many a demon in the kitchen, whether the deliciousness in the pot is Cantonese, Sichuanese, Japanese or French. So deep is the citys love of food and so broad its culinary repertoire that whatever your gastronomic desires, Hong Kong will find a way to sate them. The answer could be a bowl of wonton noodles, freshly steamed dim sum, a warm pineapple bun wedged with butter, a pair of the sweetest prawns, your first-ever stinky tofu, or the creations of the latest celebrity chef.\n\nShopping\n\nFrom off-the-rack Chinese gowns to bespoke speciality knives (and vice versa), the sheer variety of products in Hong Kong’s shops is dizzying. Every budget, need and whim is catered for in can do spirit by a similarly impressive assortment of venues: glitzy malls where the moneyed shop, chic side-street boutiques and vintage dens where fashionistas find their gems, nerdy gadget bazaars, and a mix of markets where you can haggle to your hearts content. The city has no sales tax so prices are generally attractive to visitors.\n\nCulture\n\nUnderneath the glass and steel of Hong Kongs commercial persona is a dynamic cultural landscape where its Chinese roots, colonial connections and the contributions of its home-grown talent become intertwined. Here you are just as likely to find yourself dissecting art in the dizzying number of contemporary galleries as joining in dawn taichi or reading the couplets of a local poet to the drumbeat of a dragon boat. Culture could also mean indie music by the harbour or Chinese opera in a bamboo theatre, not to mention the thousands of shows staged year-round at the citys many museums and concert halls.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/hong-kong"

Each step made its mark in the form of stones or traditions that remain at parties and celebrations of its 16 native peoples.

"Berlin","When people think of Berlin, the first thing that usually comes to mind is its most famous landmark – the Brandenburg Gate. For decades a symbol of division, the monument has always been the beating heart of a major city bursting with ideas, inspiration, art, culture and creativity. Highlights in the western parts of Berlin include the Kurfürstendamm, as elegant a shopping street as youll find anywhere, the Kaufhaus des Westens department store (better known as KaDeWe), on-trend boutiques and exclusive galleries, as well as beautiful residential streets and, of course, Berlins famous nightlife. And speaking of nightlife, no trip to Berlin would be complete without an evening at Friedrichstadt Palast, Germanys leading variety theatre. The cosmopolitan vibe also permeates the government district, which spreads out to the east from Brandenburg Gate and from the neighbouring Reichstag. Theres a sense of peace and freedom in the air here – in stark contrast to the days when Berlin was responsible for unthinkable crimes. The memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe, a work by New York architect Peter Eisenman located near the Brandenburg Gate, serves as a reminder of those atrocities, as does the Topography of Terror documentation centre at the former Gestapo headquarters.\n\nBerlins prestigious Unter den Linden boulevard extends eastwards from Brandenburg Gate towards Alexanderplatz square, passing the Museum Island World Heritage site, as well as Berlin Cathedral, the Neue Wache and the baroque Zeughaus (armoury), which today houses the German Historical Museum. Keep going far enough and youll reach the TV tower, which to this day remains the tallest structure in Germany. The view from the top, stretching across Berlin and all the way to Brandenburg, is a major sightseeing highlight. Nearby is Gendarmenmarkt, widely lauded as Berlins most beautiful square. The German Cathedral, the French Cathedral and the Concert Hall form an ensemble of great majesty and grandeur here. The atmosphere of the Hackesche Höfe, also within the central Mitte district, is somewhat less grand, but all the more laid-back, easygoing and relaxed for it. This retail complex is the largest series of enclosed courtyards in Germany and has been heritage-listed since 1977. For an authentic taste of Old Berlin, explore the courtyards vibrant mix of art galleries, cinemas, theatres, variety venues, restaurants and bars, not to mention all the welcoming little shops and big-name flagship stores. Theres also no escaping the citys artistic flair here. A characteristic that, nearly a quarter of a century after the fall of the Berlin Wall, remains a defining feature, perhaps more so than in any other capital. Berlin is the creative workshop of Germany, a trendsetter and a capital of fashion, design and music. The progressive spirit of optimism that engulfed the reunified city was – and still is – astounding. Hundreds of backyard art studios emerged from the shadows and art soon began to take over streets, the walls of buildings and even entire districts. Famously, artists have also appropriated the remains of the Berlin Wall: the section from Oberbaum bridge to Ostbahnhof station, now going by the name of East Side Gallery, has become an illustrated encyclopaedia of street art. Today, Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg, Neukölln and Wedding are the districts of choice for more than 20,000 artists. It is this creative force that lies behind the citys distinctive vibe – a vibe that renders Berlin the capital for alternative and established art alike. Immerse yourself in this creative cosmos. Let yourself be inspired, seduced and enchanted. Get to know the people of Berlin. Besides all the sightseeing, the locals are arguably the best reason to discover this incredible city – and the perfect excuse to come back and visit.","https://www.germany.travel/en/towns-cities-culture/towns-cities/berlin.html"
"Hamburg","How do you like the sound of a port sightseeing tour followed by a stroll through the old town before heading to HafenCity, Hamburgs new city centre? Or perhaps the other way around… ? There are countless ways to discover the beguiling character of this Hanseatic trade centre that is at once steeped in tradition and at the forefront of modernity. That said, no visit to Hamburg would be complete without a boat trip around one of Europes biggest ports. Sightseeing boats launch from the Landungsbrücken jetties and weave their way through huge container vessels, majestic steam-powered ocean liners and elegant yachts; an experience that can only be described as unforgettable. Make your visit all the more memorable with a leisurely stroll through the old town, where noble merchants once traded coffee, tea and spices. Today its an inviting scene of residences and grand corner buildings from the 17th to the 19th century, quaint restaurants and laid-back bars. Another reminder of Hamburgs heritage is the historical Speicherstadt, home to the worlds largest single complex of traditional brick warehouses, resting on thousands of oak supports and intersected by narrow waterways, the Fleets. Or if you want to discover the Hamburg of today and tomorrow, head to HafenCity, one of the largest inner-city construction projects in Europe and a contrast between seafaring heritage and cutting-edge architecture in the heart of the Überseequartier. Nestled between Speicherstadt and the port, this maritime world of discovery and shopping paradise stretches all the way to the Hamburg Cruise Center along a broad boulevard.\n\nIf this place doesnt give you a taste for cruises, then nothing ever will. After seeing some of the worlds biggest and most spectacular cruise ships sailing in and out of Hamburgs port, youre sure to leave with aspirations of sailing the seven seas. The people of Hamburg are especially fond of the Queen Mary 2, a vessel for whom the city has become something of a second home. Every time the majestic ocean liner comes into port, thousands of well-wishers line the Elbe to welcome her – often accompanied by a huge fireworks display and always with great exuberance.\n\nThere are many places to enjoy spectacular views of the citys maritime goings-on, such as the viewpoint at the Cruise Center, or from the Perlenkette along the banks of the Elbe with its luxurious residences and exclusive restaurants, or from the Magellan Terraces that give an unparalleled view of Hamburgs latest landmark, the Elbe Philharmonic Hall on the western tip of HafenCity. One of the best places to see Hamburg in all its glory is the public viewing platform at the futuristic Dockland office building, which rises up from the Elbe at a height of 40 metres. Views of a very different kind are on offer in the lively, slightly flipped-out alternative quarter of St. Pauli with its famous red light district the Reeperbahn. Or theres the fish market in Altona, where fresh fish (and much more besides) is auctioned every Sunday at the crack of dawn – a shopping experience like no other. And speaking of shopping, Hamburg has something for everyone, including on the Jungfernstieg, the citys chic centre of shopping and finance that begins at the Inner Alster. Even here, in the heart of the city, you can take a gentle stroll along the riverside promenades. The same is true of the Outer Alster, the perfect place for a spot of leisure and recreation within easy reach of central Hamburg. And if you get the impression that the people of Hamburg simply cant get enough of the water, then youd be absolutely right.","https://www.germany.travel/en/towns-cities-culture/towns-cities/magic-cities/hamburg.html"
"Munich","A modern, cosmopolitan city with a big heart and a long heritage, as suave as it is easygoing, buzzing and yet tranquil. Munich is Germanys lifestyle capital. You dont have to be rich and beautiful to feel right at home in Munich, but it doesnt hurt. Besides, these characteristics arent confined to strict dictionary definitions. Rich is he who has the time to leisurely amble through the splendid city centre, stopping here and there just to soak up the atmosphere. And beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all. That said, undoubtedly one of the most beautiful squares in Germany has to be Marienplatz square – it is the heart of Munich and is home to the Old and New Town Halls. The town hall glockenspiel is as much part of Munichs identity as the Hofbräuhaus beer hall or the iconic Church of Our Lady, whose green dome-crested towers can be seen for miles around. Browsing the stalls of the Viktualienmarkt is a feast for all the senses. Theres simply everything on offer at the citys famous food market – from traditional Bavarian specialities to exotic delicacies. But take note, bargaining and haggling have no place in the Munich lifestyle – so dont be tempted to try, least of all on the luxury shopping boulevards such as Ludwigstrasse, Maximilianstrasse, Kaufinger Strasse or the Tal. Everything on sale in these streets has a high price to match its high quality, from the latest fashions to wonderful antiques. For a far more affordable, not to mention more relaxed, shopping experience, head to Munichs pub and club quarter, which is no longer confined to the trendy Schwabing district, but also extends around Glockenbachviertel, Gärtnerplatz square and Müllerstrasse. The area is as renowned for its party atmosphere as it is for its alternative shops, its relaxed atmosphere and its vibrant LGBT scene.\n\nA trip to the English Garden doesnt cost you a penny and Munichs very own piece of paradise, situated between the Isar and the city centre, is the ultimate chill-out zone. From lazing around or watching people master the latest craze of slacklining (better still, have a go yourself) to the insane fun of surfing the Eisbach river, anything goes in the park. Add to that two of Munichs most beautiful beer gardens, one at the Chinese Pagoda, the other at a picturesque lakeside spot, and youve got the perfect recipe for a relaxing afternoon. These are the beer gardens where youll find an eclectic crowd who live life to the full in the shade of ancient chestnut trees. Thats the Munich way. The beer gardens came to be called cellars or keller – as in Salvatorkeller, Löwenbräukeller and Hofbräukeller – because brewers once kept their beer underground to keep it cool and soon hit upon the idea of selling it from the very same spot. This was the start of a sacred tradition that, as luck would have it, is alive and well among locals today.\n\nThe people of Munich are also proud of the citys museums, many of which are of international standing, such as the Deutsches Museum, the worlds biggest science and technology museum, the Alte Pinakothek, the Neue Pinakothek, the Pinakothek der Moderne and the Lenbachhaus Museum. Then theres the Glyptothek Museum, the State Collections of Antiques and the Brandhorst Museum with its breathtaking collection of modern art from 1945 onwards. Here in Munichs Art Quarter, however, youll also find charming little bars, cosy cafés and pretty boutiques, yet another example of how the Munich lifestyle combines culture with the finer things in life. The BMW Museum has the citys automotive heritage covered, while the stars of Bayern Munich show teams visiting the Allianz Arena another side to the citys unique lifestyle: what its like to always be on top. Even if youre not a Bayern Munich fan, its still well worth trying to get a ticket to see them play. The stadium atmosphere alone is world-class and guaranteed to give you goosebumps. And you wont be surprised to discover that the Allianz Arena is one of the worlds most spectacular stadiums. It is, after all, in Munich.","https://www.germany.travel/en/towns-cities-culture/towns-cities/munich.html"
"Cologne","When you hear cheers of Kölle alaaf across Cologne, it can mean only one thing: the mayhem of carnival has arrived (or Fastelovend as its also known). Completely crazy or out of its mind dont even come close to describing the scenes in the cathedral city the week before Ash Wednesday. Carnival season begins in Cologne on 11 November at 11.11am and finishes on Ash Wednesday as it does everywhere else in Germany. But thats where the similarities end. As everyone can see, Cologne carnival is in a league of its own, especially in the final week when the street carnival has the city firmly in its grip. To experience Colognes unique exuberance at any other time of year, drop in to one of the traditional and welcoming bars in the area around Alter Markt and Heumarkt square or the large brewery taverns scattered throughout the old quarter. Kölsch – the citys signature beer – never stops flowing there, the kitchens dish up Rhineland specialities and there is so much friendly and light-hearted revelry you would think it were carnival all year round. Every type of kölsch has its own distinctive flavour – and, of course, its own brewery. The beer waiters, known as Köbes, remain immune to the general merriment: a certain gruffness is the hallmark of a genuine Köbes. The only thing that can dim the exuberance of Colognes residents lies some 30 kilometres up the river Rhine in the form of Düsseldorf, whose reserved character couldnt be more different to Colognes wild exuberance.\n\nThe scores of clubs, pubs, bars and restaurants in the city are heaving with locals and tourists, young people and students, particularly at the weekends. Popular haunts are the student district Kwartier Latäng, Friesenviertel, Belgisches Viertel, Südstadt and – increasingly – Ehrenfeld, traditionally an industrial quarter. Prices are surprisingly reasonable, especially for a city of this size. But its not just carnival, bars and breweries. Colognes vibrant arts and music scene also encapsulates the citys lust for life. The Cologne Musical Dome is the citys biggest theatre, with 1,700 seats, and is famed for its spectacular productions. Then theres Christopher Street Day, Germanys largest event for the gay and lesbian community. Alternatively, a home match for the citys Bundesliga football team never fails to entertain – even if the clubs position in the league table doesnt always live up to the fans high hopes.\n\nSomething guaranteed to surpass expectations, however, is the citys museum scene, in particular the magnificent Ludwig Museum which features works by Picasso, Warhol and Lichtenstein. Theres also the Romano-Germanic Museum, where the exhibits span 2,000 years of history, the Wallraf Richartz Museum, with art from the Middle Ages through to the 19th century, and the chocolate museum for sweet-toothed visitors. If the culture and excitement of Cologne takes its toll and you need some time to relax, head to Rhine Park, one of the largest and prettiest in the city. Locals describe this park on the eastern bank of the Rhine as being on the wrong side of the river. Nevertheless, you can get over there on the cable car. And if, after all that, you still have some time to spare, why not head to KölnTriangle? At a height of 100 metres, the observation deck offers probably the best view of Cologne old town and its . On a fine day, you might even see as far as Düsseldorf – just dont tell your friends in Cologne!","https://www.germany.travel/en/towns-cities-culture/towns-cities/magic-cities/cologne.html"
"Frankfurt","Most people associate Frankfurt with brokers, banks, stocks and shares – and they wouldnt be wrong, but there is much more to the city than just big business. Frankfurt does, after all, have an unrivalled museum scene. The museum embankment on the southern bank of the Main is a wonder to behold, in particular the magnificent Städel Institute of Art with the Municipal Gallery. Situated in the heart of Frankfurts museum mile, this is of one Germanys preeminent art galleries and features masterpieces spanning nine centuries of European art. The underground extension houses a collection of works from 1945 onwards, including such famous names as Joseph Beuys and Gerhard Richter. To the east of the gallery you will find the film museum and the architecture museum, which in itself is an innovative and unconventional example of building design. And just a stones throw from there stands the Museum of Applied Art (MAK). A thousand years of arts and crafts are represented in this striking building designed by American architect Richard Meier. On the opposite riverbank, again only a few minutes away, the Museum of Modern Art (MMK) designed by Hans Hollein is well worth a visit. As is the Schirn Kunsthalle gallery, which has made a name for itself a leading exhibition house in Germany and Europe. There are also a number of smaller galleries around the cathedral, some of which are less mainstream but feature exceptional displays of art nonetheless. You can even admire art in the metro system. The Grenzland (borderland) project at the Dom/Römer station, for example, showcases works that blur the lines between art, architecture and design.\n\nFrom its early days in the 12th century to its new beginnings after 1945, Jewish culture and history have often reached beyond the realms of comprehension. The Jewish Museum, housed within the historical rooms of the former Rothschild Palace, and its Judengasse branch bear witness to this past with both sensitivity and accuracy. Frankfurts most famous son is Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. You can retrace the famous writers footsteps for a glimpse of 18th century Frankfurt. For example at Goethes House or in the slightly less poetic setting of the Gerbermühle, a quaint beer garden on the banks of the river Main, where the great poet indulged in an occasional glass of cider in his day. The Gerbermühle was also a likely haunt of the Frankfurt doctor Heinrich Hoffmann, whose illustrated Struwwelpeter books became classics of childrens literature. In a beautiful old villa in the upmarket Westend district there is a museum devoted to the childrens author, featuring drawings, rare editions of his works, translations, parodies and much more besides. And if that tickles your funny bone, you should be sure to stop by Caricatura, Germanys leading museum for sophisticated satire and comic art. F.W. Bernstein, Robert Gernhardt, Chlodwig Poth, Hans Traxler, F.K. Waechter, Bernd Pfarr and many others are guaranteed to put a smile on visitors faces.\n\nIt might be more serious, but the financial district is well worth a visit for a true taste of Frankfurt. The towering banks and office blocks form Europes most impressive skyline, and Frankfurts ultimate landmark. But rest assured, the art found in this part of the city is also of international standing. Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and DZ Bank own art collections any museum would be proud of, and these are opened to the public at certain times. Skyscrapers as art galleries? Only in Frankfurt.","https://www.germany.travel/en/towns-cities-culture/towns-cities/magic-cities/frankfurt.html"
"Stuttgart","The car has many fathers, but just one home town. Since the day Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach put together the first ever small, high-speed petrol engine in the glasshouse they used as workshop (now a much-visited attraction), that home town has been none other than Stuttgart. That was in 1885, and the three-pointed star has shone brightly over the automotive world ever since. Nowhere does this shine brighter, of course, than above the Mercedes-Benz Museum, the only museum in the world to present the history of the automotive industry from start to finish. Before you even step foot in the building you are struck by the museums futuristic design – and once inside, you cannot fail to be mesmerised by the 160 automotive gems on display. There are other treasures on show at the Mercedes-Benz Classic Car Centre in Fellbach, including such motoring legends as the 300 SL gullwing. Another brand known for its iconic vehicles is, of course, Porsche – and the classics in the Porsche Museum are guaranteed to turn heads. At the heritage-listed former regional airport, the Meilenwerk is a favourite among fans of vintage vehicles, featuring everything they could ever need for keeping their prized possessions looking as good as new, as well as a place to stay in the form of the V8 Hotel. Every March, fans of classic cars from around the world descend on Stuttgart for the Retro Classics, Germanys best-loved motor show. Retro Classic meets Baroque, meanwhile, offers the exclusive opportunity to see classic cars set against the historical backdrop of stunning Ludwigsburg Palace.\n\nBack in the present day, a tour of the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen offers an in-depth look behind the scenes at a state-of-the-art car factory – something that is sure to reawaken one or two hidden desires for such a prestige purchase. Nevertheless, it doesnt take long to realise that Stuttgart has more to offer than automotive temptation alone. The surrounding wine region, one of the largest in Germany, plays a significant part in the Stuttgart locals other passions: exquisite food and fine wine. Stuttgarts restaurants and cafés offer up a whole range of gastronomic treats, from spätzle noodles to pinot noir, from corner pubs to award-winning, internationally renowned restaurants. Festivals of every size, the most famous being the Cannstatter Wasen, provide ample opportunity to join in the celebrations, enjoy the local hospitality and live life to the full. The perfect starting point for a sightseeing tour here is Schlossplatz square: in virtually no other city does a palace dominate the centre to such an extent as Stuttgarts Neues Schloss (New Palace). For those who have spent the day admiring the exceptional collection of modernist and contemporary art in the neighbouring Stuttgart Art Museum, or learning about history from the Stone Age to the modern era at the Altes Schloss (Old Palace), an evening of sophistication and relaxation is in order. And when it comes to the performing arts, Stuttgart is once again first class. Its State Theatre is the largest multi-genre theatre in the world and its ballet, theatrical productions and state opera have all enjoyed international acclaim for decades. Music lovers are well catered for by Stuttgarts acclaimed orchestras, its many jazz clubs and the musicals performed in the SI-Centrum entertainment complex. Alternatively, you can browse the world-class shopping streets of Königstrasse and Calwerstrasse at your leisure. And be sure to make time to discover the much-loved Wilhelma Gardens. These remarkable zoological and botanical gardens are home to around 8,000 animals, making this one of the worlds most bio-diverse zoos. Whats more, theres not a car in sight, so you might just forget where you are.\n\n",https://www.germany.travel/en/towns-cities-culture/towns-cities/stuttgart.html
"Düsseldorf","Its here that the industry decides whats going to be big next season. Düsseldorf is, after all, the fashion capital of Germany. More than 800 showrooms present the latest designer and couture creations, and not just during trade show times. Königsallee, meanwhile, is lined with exclusive boutiques, where its all too easy to succumb to temptation in the name of fashion. The enticing names of Marco Polo, Hugo Boss, Strellson and Calvin Klein are in good company alongside Armani, Bulgari, Gucci, Jil Sander, Prada, Tiffany & Co. and Versace, forming a stronghold of refined taste.\n\n\Königsallee is one of only a handful of internationally regarded streets that can justifiably call themselves a boulevard. Known affectionately as Kö, this street is the beating heart of the fashion city, a veritable catwalk lined by beautiful old chestnut trees. Here its about seeing and being seen, and putting your best foot forward. But the Kö is not the only place to get your fill of fashion and shopping; if you have a taste for the finer things in life, youll love every bit of Düsseldorf.

And, of course, the old town, whose laid-back vibe has attracted unconventional fashion boutiques and numerous alternative stores.

But it would be doing a disservice to Düsseldorf to describe it only as a fashion and shopping mecca. The city has so much more to offer. Culturally minded travellers are particularly well catered for, with events such as the Old Town Autumn attracting tens of thousands of visitors. Düsseldorf also prides itself on its theatres, concert halls, art galleries and places of historical interest, as well as its magnificent parks and gardens.

One of Germanys most beautiful squares, this is the ultimate weekend and evening hangout for the people of Düsseldorf. So sit back with a glass of altbier, look out to the Rhine and just enjoy the moment. And if you happen to notice that the passers-by are exceptionally well dressed, then you can probably guess where theyve done their shopping.","https://www.germany.travel/en/towns-cities-culture/towns-cities/magic-cities/duesseldorf.html"

"Graz","Austria’s second-largest city is its most relaxed and an instant heart-stealer, with abundant parkland, a sea of red rooftops and a narrow but fast-flowing river loudly gushing through its centre. A very beautiful bluff – connected to the centre by steps, a funicular and a glass lift – is the city's signature attribute. Architecturally, Graz hints at nearby Italy with its Renaissance courtyards and baroque palaces. That said, there's a youthful energy here too, with a handful of edgily modern buildings, a vibrant arts scene and upbeat, student-fuelled nightlife. This extends to both sides of the Mur, although the Lend district, across from the historic centre, skews young and edgy.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/the-south/graz"
"Linz","'In Linz beginnt’s' (it begins in Linz) goes the Austrian saying, and it’s spot on. This is a city on the move, with its finger on the pulse of the country's technology industry.

"Salzburg","The joke 'If it's baroque, don't fix it' is a perfect maxim for Salzburg: the story-book Altstadt (old town) burrowed below steep hills looks much as it did when Mozart lived here 250 years ago. Beside the fast-flowing Salzach River, your gaze is raised inch by inch to graceful domes and spires, the formidable clifftop fortress and the mountains beyond. It's a backdrop that did the lordly prince-archbishops and Maria proud.\n\nBeyond Salzburg’s two biggest money-spinners – Mozart and The Sound of Music – hides a city with a burgeoning arts scene, wonderful food, manicured parks, quiet side streets where classical music wafts from open windows, and concert halls that uphold musical tradition 365 days a year. Everywhere you go, the scenery, the skyline, the music and the history send your spirits soaring higher than Julie Andrews' octave-leaping vocals.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/salzburg"
"Innsbruck","Tyrol’s capital is a sight to behold. The jagged rock spires of the Nordkette range are so close that within minutes it’s possible to travel from the city's heart to more than 2000m above sea level and alpine pastures where cowbells chime. Summer and winter activities abound, and it’s understandable why some visitors only take a peek at Innsbruck proper before heading for the hills. But to do so is a shame, for Innsbruck is in many ways Austria in microcosm: its late-medieval Altstadt is picture-book stuff, presided over by a grand Habsburg palace and baroque cathedral, while its Olympic ski jump with big mountain views makes a spectacular leap between the urban and the outdoors.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/tirol/innsbruck"
"Klagenfurt","Klagenfurt is an enjoyable, vibrant and sunny city with a compact Inner Stadt. While it may not be up there with Vienna or Graz in terms of urban lifestyle, it offers easy access to lakeside villages on and around the beautiful Wörthersee.\n\nAt the city’s western limit is the wide green space of Europapark, along with Austria's largest bathing complex. It's a surprisingly lively place, both as a playground for partiers down at the lido in summer and as a university town the rest of the year. Transport links also make it the best base for exploring the whole of Carinthia.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/the-south/klagenfurt"

There may be more picturesque cities in the region, however, with the town itself having little in the way of sights.\n\nLike its close neighbour Klagenfurt half an hour away on the motorway, the Italian influence here is strong. Consider using it as a base for activities and for exploring the region.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/tirol/villach"
"Dornbirn","Ragged, thickly wooded limestone pinnacles are the dramatic backdrop to Dornbirn, Vorarlberg’s largest city. While nowhere near as appealing as Bregenz, it’s worth a visit for its refreshing lack of tourists and remarkable museums.\n\nHohenems, 6km south of Dornbirn, sheltered a large Jewish community in the 17th century. Their numbers dwindled in the 1860s, when Jews were eligible to live anywhere under Habsburg rule.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/dornbirn"
"Wiener","Though slightly off the tourist trail, Wiener Neustadt is worth a halt for its cathedral and main square, plus its low-key, authentic feel that's a long way from the region's tourist spots.\n\nThe town used to be known simply as Neustadt (New Town) or Nova Civitas and was built by the Babenbergs in 1194 with the help of King Richard the Lionheart’s ransom payment (so if you're English, those town walls, by rights, belong to you!). It became a Habsburg residence in the 15th century during the reign of Friedrich III. His famous AEIOU (Alles Erdreich Ist Österreich Untertan; Everything in the world is subservient to Austria) engraving can be found throughout the city. The town was severely damaged in WWII (only 18 homes were left unscathed), so what you see today is mainly a post-war rebuild.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/wiener-neustadt"
"Steyr","Franz Schubert called Steyr ‘inconceivably lovely’ and was inspired to pen the sprightly Trout Quintet here. And lovely it is: on the confluence of the swiftly flowing Enns and Steyr Rivers, the postcard-like old town of cobbled lanes and candy-hued baroque houses is one of Upper Austria’s most attractive.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/steyr"
"Athens","With equal measures of grunge and grace, Athens is a heady mix of ancient history and contemporary cool.\n\nAcropolis Views\n\nThe magnificent Acropolis, visible from almost every part of the city, is the hub around which Athens still revolves. This temple city, built in the 5th century BC, serves as a daily reminder to Greeks of their heritage and the city's many transformations. All over the urban basin, rooftops and balconies angle toward the landmark, a block of milky marble atop a steep-sided hill. Pull up your own chair, settle in and allow time to appreciate the Acropolis' many moods, as the light shifts and the clouds cast their shifting shadows.\n\nLayers of History\n\nThe cultural and social life of Athens plays out amid, around and in landmarks that are centuries old, if not millennia. The remnants of Ancient Greece get the most attention, of course, thanks to a little thing called democracy. Oh, and mythology, and drama, and philosophy. But don't overlook the 'later' years: thousand-year-old Byzantine churches, for instance, which squat, unruffled in the middle of streets and attached to hillsides. Ottoman traces can be seen in architecture and in food. And the neoclassical style of the 19th century adds elegance all over the centre.\n\nCreative Energy\n\nAlthough Athenians have endured difficult circumstances since the start of the economic crisis in 2009, the city as a whole crackles with energy in art shows, political debates and even on the walls of derelict buildings, as Athens has become one of Europe's most noted spots for street art. Creative surprises lie around nearly every corner, so be sure to leave room in your schedule for spontaneous discovery: buy a ticket to that dance show that's just starting as you walk by, or sit down at the restaurant where the musicians are setting up. You'll be rewarded.\n\nBeaches and Ruins\n\nBeyond Athens, down the Attica peninsula, are more spectacular antiquities, such as the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion and the site of Ancient Eleusis, as well as very good beaches, such as those near historical Marathon. Sure, you could zip across, west to east, in less than an hour, but it's far more fun to take a leisurely road trip to a thermally heated lake, say, or a monastery with dazzling Byzantine mosaics. If you'd rather not drive, most of these surprise sights (including great beaches) can be reached on public transport.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/greece/athens"
"Thessaloniki","Thessaloniki is easy to fall in love with – it has beauty, chaos, history and culture, a remarkable cuisine and wonderful, vast sea views. This is Greece’s second city, which, like the rest of the country, has suffered the hit of the economic crisis, but the streets remain full of life and vibrancy.\n\nThe different neighbourhoods are little worlds unto themselves, and when you climb up to the Byzantine walls and take in the whole of Thessaloniki at sunset, you see what a sprawling, organic city it is. Old and new cohabit wonderfully: the Arch of Galerius, an intricate 4th-century monument, overlooks the busy shopping drag of Egnatia, while Thessaloniki’s most famous sight, the White Tower, anchors a waterfront packed with cocktail bars. The revamped waterfront area breathes life and is great for walking and cycling. By night, the city reverberates with music and nightlife.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/greece/northern-greece/thessaloniki"
"Larissa","Set at the heart of the great agricultural plain of Thessaly, on the east bank of the Pinios River, the city of Larissa has been inhabited for almost 10,000 years. Although the remnants of its layered Byzantine and Ottoman pasts lie scattered to all sides, Larissa is very much a modern metropolis. A major transport, military and service hub, it’s also a vibrant university town, where lively cafes surround the central squares, shops galore line the pedestrianised streets and fine museums lurk in the suburbs.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/greece/larisa"
"Piraeus","Ten kilometres southwest of central Athens, Piraeus is dazzling in its scale, its seemingly endless quays filled with ferries, ships and hydrofoils. It's the biggest port in the Mediterranean (more than 20 million passengers pass through annually), the hub of the Aegean ferry network, the centre of Greece’s maritime trade and the base for its large merchant navy. While technically its own city, it melds into the Athens sprawl, with close to half a million people living in the greater area.\n\nShabby and congested, central Piraeus is not a place where visitors normally choose to linger. Beyond its shipping offices, banks and public buildings are a jumble of pedestrian precincts, shopping strips and rather grungy areas. The most attractive quarter lies east around Zea Marina, Pasalimani and Mikrolimano harbours. The latter is lined with cafes, restaurants and bars filled with Athenians, locals and visitors.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/greece/athens/piraeus"
"Heraklion","Crete’s capital, Iraklio (also called Heraklion), is Greece’s fifth-largest city and the island’s economic and administrative hub. It's also home to Crete's blockbuster sights: the must-see Heraklion Archaeological Museum and the nearby Palace of Knossos, which both provide fascinating windows into Crete's ancient past.\n\nThough not pretty in a conventional way, Iraklio definitely grows on you if you take the time to explore its layers and wander its backstreets. You'll discover a low-key urban sophistication with a thriving cafe and restaurant scene, good shopping and bustling nightlife. A revitalised waterfront invites strolling, and the newly pedestrianised historic centre is punctuated by bustling squares flanked by buildings from the time when Christopher Columbus first set sail.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/greece/crete/iraklio"
"Acharnes","Acharnes is a suburb of Athens, Attica, Greece. With 106,943 population 2011 census, it's far the most populous municipality in East Attica. It is part of the Athens Urban location. Acharnes was named after the deme Acharnae Ancient, a subdivision of Athens in classical antiquity. The Athenian playwright Aristophanes characterised the population of Acharnae as peasants in his play “The Acharnians”. Acharnes suffered vast damage from the 1999 Athens earthquake, being very near the epicenter.\n\nThe municipality Acharnes was fashioned at the 2011 neighborhood government reform with the aid of the merger of the following 2 former municipalities, that have become municipal units. The Folk Art Museum of Acharnes is a museum in Acharnes, a northern suburb of Athens, Greece. It became based in 1977 with the aid of the neighborhood Greek Mountaineering Society, which additionally fashioned the Historical and Folklore Association in 1981, to which it bequeathed the museum in 1982. The archaeological a part of the gathering changed into then separated from the historic and folklore material and turned into given to the Hellenic Ministry of Culture.","https://www.hellotravel.com/greece/acharnes"
"Kallith","Internationally acknowledged, Kallithea resort area is visited each year by thousands of tourists, wishing to discover its incredulous nature, rich history and engaging nightlife. Besides these qualities, Kallithea is an excellent base for an active vacation, from where you can easily reach any destination on the Kassandra peninsula.\n\nAdditional assets Kallithea disposes of are marvelous views over the sea towards the Sithonia peninsula (Kallithea means “the beautiful view”). You can have the best view from the spacious park.\n\nKallithea is one of the largest commercial hubs of Kassandra, and in the village, you can find numerous hotels and other accommodation facilities – rental apartments, rooms and studios. Its beach bars and discotheques are the synonym for entertaining nightlife that made Kallithea popular among the younger population. You can also buy yourself a souvenir in the village’s souvenir stores.\n\nBefore the night comes, though, you can enjoy the resort area’s blue sea and golden sand beaches, edged by the pine trees. The beach has a gradual entrance into the water, which is especially convenient for the children and older population. If you have forgotten your equipment for the beach, don’t worry. You can rent parasols, sun beds and sport equipment.\n\nKallithea is the site of some significant archaeological findings. The Temple of Ammon Zeus is the Doric sanctuary originated in the 4th B.C. The greatest value of the Chapel of Agios (Saint) Panteleimon is its interesting murals, depicted on the internal walls. The third archaeological site is dedicated to God Dionysus and the Nymphs.","http://visitkassandra.com/halkidiki/kallithea/"
"Heraklion","Heraklion is the largest city of Crete and one of Greece’s major urban centers. Its development begun in the wake of the 9th century AD (in antiquity, Knossos was the island’s most important centre, followed by Gortyn). In later times, Heraklion came under Arabic, Venetian and Ottoman rule; its conquerors initially gave it the name Khandaq or Handak which was corrupted to Candia. During the 2004 Olympic Games, the city of Heraklion provided one of the venues for the football tournament.\n\n\nAmong the most outstanding sights of Heraklion are the fortification walls that delimit the “old city”. The first fortifications were built by the Arabs and were later reinforced by the Venetians (15th century). From the seven bastions, only the Martinengo bastion survives to this day; there visitors will find the tomb of the renowned writer N. Kazantzakis, overlooking the city. From the four gates to the city, only Chanioporta (1570) with the characteristic winged Lion of Saint Marc and the New Gate (1587) at the southern side survive today.\n\n\nIn the old (Venetian) port, next to the modern facilities, one can see the vaulted tarsanades where ships used to be built, while the western side is dominated by the Koule fortress (16th century).\n\n\nKoule fortress. Source:© www.heraklion.gr\n\n\nIn the heart of the city there are many monuments dating to the Middle Ages, a period in which Heraklion witnessed great prosperity. From the port, ascending 25 Avgoustou (August) street, one reaches a square where the church of Agios Titos is found (built in 1872 at the site where a Byzantine church once stood), while next to it lies the Venetian Loggia (16th century), a magnificent, ornate arcaded Venetian building decorated with blazons, trophies, etc., which served as a meeting place for the Duke and other noblemen during the Venetian period.\n\n\nA typical feature of Heraklion is its Venetian and Turkish fountains, scattered all around the city. The most famous one is the Venetian-style Μorozinifountain, also known as the Lions (1628), a landmark for local inhabitants and visitors alike. Other noteworthy Venetian fountains are the Bembo fountain (1552-1554) on Kornaros Square, the Sagredo fountain (1602-1604) built in the northwestern corner of the Loggia, and Priuli fountain (1666) located near the port.\n\n\nThe most interesting Turkish fountains are the Charity fountain (1776), next to the Bembo fountain, which today functions as a café, the “Idomeneas fountain” (behind the Historical Museum of Crete), the “Genitsar Aga Fountain” (on Ikarou street), etc.\n\n\nAmong the churches of Heraklion the one that stands out is the imposing and sizeable Metropolis of Agios Minas (on Agia Ekaterini Square), built between 1862-1895. Adjacent to it, stands the chapel of Mikros Agios Minas and on the northeast is situated the church of Agia Ekaterini (16th century), which functionsas a museum housing exhibits from the Cretan Renaissance. The church of Agios Markos (13th century) towers over Venizelou Square, while other important churches in the city are the Monastery of Agios Petros and Pavlos, the Panagia Akrotiriani, the Panagia ton Stavroforon, etc.\n\n\nOne should not miss out on a visit to the Archaeological Museum, one of the most important museums in Greece; it contains almost all the unique treasures of the Minoan civilization unearthed at Knossos, Phaistos, Malia and other sites. Other museums that are worth visiting are the Historical Museum, the Museum of Natural History and the Acquarium  “Cretaquarium” (in the area of Gournes).\n\n\nIn the market of Heraklion, one of the richest in the Mediterranean, visitors can find all sorts of modern products, as well as traditional Cretan products such the famous Cretan olive oil, raki, local wine, honey, herbs, etc. Moreover, a modern golf course  both for beginners and advanced players operates not far away from the city of Heraklion (in the area of Hersonisos).\n\n\nIn the environs of Heraklion\n\n\nFive km south of Heraklion lies Knossos, one of the most important archeological sites in Europe, the legendary centre of the Minoan civilization from 1900 to 1400 BC. The Palace of Knossos, the largest one in Minoan Crete, witnessed two architectural phases and which was devastated by the earthquake of Santorini (1450 BC). The site contains the remains of the palace of Minos, of dwellings occupied by officials, priests and residents, as well as of cemeteries. The Palace was an intricate building complexbuilt around a central court.  It was laid out on a surface of 22,000 m2 and apart from the royal apartments, it encompassed were also ceremonial quarters, treasure rooms, workshops and storage spaces.\n\n\n63 km southwest of Heraklion lie the remains of the Phaistos Palace, second in importance in Minoan Crete, inhabited since the Neolithic times. The architectural layout of the palace is identical to the one of Knossos. Here too, rooms are clustered around a paved court. As regards the interior decoration, the Phaistos Palace did not yield many frescoes, however, the floors and walls are covered with stark-white gypsum slabs. The Palace occupied a surface of 9,000 m2 approximately.\n\n\nKnossos\n\n\nMoreover, in the vicinity of Malia (34 km east of Heraklion) excavations have brought to light a palace similar to the one of Knossos and Phaistos. At Hrissolakos (Pit of Gold), archaeologists also unearthed the districts surrounding the Minoan palace and cemetery. The palace covered an area of about 9,000 m2.\n\n\nFinally, 46 km south of Heraklion lies the archaeological site of Gortyn, boasting finds from the 16th century BC up to the 2nd century AD.","http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/main_cities/heraklion"

Divided into numerous districts, its main hub is called the Golden Triangle which comprises Bukit Bintang, KLCC and Chinatown. KL is widely recognised for numerous landmarks, including Petronas Twin Towers (the world’s tallest twin skyscrapers), Petaling Street flea market, and Batu Caves, which is over 400 million years old.\n\nWith frequent sales events throughout the year, expansive shopping malls like Pavilion KL and Suria KLCC are also among the biggest tourist attractions in the city, hosting a wide range of upmarket labels from all over the world.

"Johor Bahru","The capital city of Johor State is a favourite haunt for visitors from Singapore via the Causeway, and is fondly referred to as ‘JB’. Rich in culture, Johor has a wealth of traditional dances that include the ‘Ghazal’, a form of contemporary jazz-like Malay music, and ‘Kuda Kepang’ a dance imitating the movement of horses.\n\nThere are many landmarks to explore such as the Grand Palace, with its distinct Anglo-Malay architecture and the Johor Art Gallery, where various art collections, artifacts and many items related to Johor's historical heritage are stored.\n\nShopping opportunities are aplenty in JB. From modern malls to handicraft centers and bazaars to markets, a large range of international and local products go on sale. This is also one of the reasons why Singaporeans absolutely adore JB.\n\nWhen night falls over the city, a delectable array of food stalls and vendors open around the streets peddling the famous Laksa Johor, a dish of flake fish and gravy cooked with coconut milk served with noodles and vegetables.\n\nIf you’re looking for cosmopolitan sights, but something not too busy like Kuala Lumpur, JB is the place to go.","http://www.malaysia-hotels.net/culturalcities/johor-bahru.htm"
"Kota Bharu","The northernmost major city in Malaysia is also one of its most devoutly Muslim and it is deeply grounded in traditional Malay heritage. Kota Bharu has all the energy of a midsized city with the compact feel and friendly vibe of a small town. There are excellent markets and ample opportunities to taste superb local cuisine. There is also a good spread of accommodation options from backpacker hostels to business hotels. This is a logical overnight stop between Thailand and the resort islands of neighbouring Terengganu: Perhentian and Redang.\n\nKota Bharu is the gateway for exploring the geography and culture of Kelantan. Many traditional Malay villages and colourful Thai Buddhist temples are within day-tripping distance, and local crafts, cuisine and culture can be found while strolling in the city itself. For exploring the interior, the enticing jungle railway passes by Kota Bharu's doorstep.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/malaysia/peninsular-malaysia-east-coast/kota-bharu"
"Klang","Unless they're making use of ferries to Sumatra, most travellers will cruise through Selangor blissfully unaware of the existence of Klang. The town is split between frenetic Klang town and its port, Pelabuhan Klang (7km east). This is a colourful place where traffic jams are made worthwhile by colonial-era architecture, and day trips beckon to islands such as culture-rich Carey and low-slung Ketam. Meanwhile, a discerning population of local food lovers are queuing for perfectly balanced bak kut teh (stewed pork ribs) and feeding an ever-growing coffee scene.\n\nKlang, 35km west of Kuala Lumpur, is easily accessed via the KTM Komuter train.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/malaysia/klang-pelabuhan-klang"
"Kampung Baru Suba","This quiet, flowery Bidayuh village, where the loudest sound is often the crowing of a cock, attracted lots of tourists back when the road ended here. These days it gets relatively few visitors, despite being a pleasant place to spend a few hours. The traditional longhouse is still home to a few families, though most villagers now live in attractive modern houses.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/malaysia/kampung-benuk"
"Ipoh","Perak's finest colonial architecture stands side by side with rickety kedai kopi (coffee shops) in chameleonic Ipoh. The capital of Perak is flanked by towering white cliffs, some with magnificent cave temples pocketed in the limestone. Sliced into old and new towns by the Kinta River, Ipoh charms with its street art and street food – rather like a languid version of George Town.\n\nIpoh is more than a gateway to the Cameron Highlands or a way station en route to Penang. Shaped by the 1920s tin-mining boom, Ipoh's wealth and population ebbed away after the mines' closure. But an old-town renaissance has revived its time-worn buildings into boutiques, hotels and gorgeously kitsch cafes.\n\nFood is reason enough to visit. Malaysian and Singaporean gastronomes arrive in droves for Ipoh's tauge ayam (chicken bean sprouts) and to argue over who serves the best kopi putih – white coffee, the town's signature drink.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/malaysia/peninsular-malaysia-west-coast/ipoh"
"Kuching","It's easy to see why Raja Brooke chose this spot for his capital. Hugging the curves of the languid Sungai Sarawak, Kuching was an ideal trading post between other Asian sea ports and Borneo's interior. It's still a gateway to both jungle and sea, and Kuching’s proximity to national parks makes it the ideal base for day trips to wild coastal and rainforest destinations.\n\nSarawak's sophisticated capital also merges cultures, crafts and cuisines, and the city's energetic collage of bustling streets and narrow alleys lined with carpenter shops, cafes and bars is best explored on foot. Attractions include time-capsule museums, Chinese temples decorated with dragons, a weekend market, heritage shophouses, and a riverfront esplanade that's perfect for a warm-evening stroll and a delicious meal.

"Moscow","During any season, at any hour of the day, Moscow thrills visitors with its artistry, history and majesty.\n\nKremlin & Red Square\n\nThe very founding site of the city (and arguably, the country), the Kremlin and Red Square are still at the heart of Moscow – historically, geographically and spiritually. Feel the weight of this significance as you wander within the walls of the ancient fortress, marvel at the mind-boggling magnificence of St Basil's Cathedral and pay your respects to the revered leader of a now-defunct state. Moscow will move you. It will tantalise your senses, soothe your spirit and boggle your mind – and it all starts right here at the Kremlin and Red Square.\n\nCommunist History\n\nThe remains of the Soviet state are scattered all around the city. Monuments remember fallen heroes and victorious battles, while museums attempt to analyse and synthesise the past. See Lenin and Stalin – off their pedestals – at the whimsical Art Muzeon. Step into the socialist-realist fantasy at VDNKh. Descend into the depths of the Soviet system at Bunker-42 Cold War Museum. Ride the museum-like metro and remember the millions who suffered at the Gulag History Museum. Nowadays, retro clubs and cafes give their guests a taste of the Soviet experience. You can even try your hand at Soviet-era arcade games.\n\nPerforming Arts\n\nWhat is more thrilling than watching a ballerina defy gravity, leaping across the stage at the glittering Bolshoi Theatre? Or feeling the force of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, just a few blocks away from where it premiered more than a century ago? Or oohing and aahing as circus performers soar under the big tent? The classical performing arts in Moscow are still among the best in the world. Nowadays, even the most traditional theatres are experimenting with innovative arrangements, reviving lost favourites and hosting world premieres. Whether you appreciate the classics or prefer the contemporary, the capital's performing arts will impress.\n\nOrthodoxy & Architecture\n\nAt nearly every turn in Moscow, you'll see golden domes peeking out over the rooftops and hear church bells peeling through the streets, which are dotted with some 600 churches – many of which are glittering after recent renovations. There are colourful hidden gems, historic fortresses and gargantuan cathedrals. The exteriors are adorned with stone carvings and glittering domes; interiors are packed with ancient icons, swirling incense and faithful worshippers. For more than a millennium, Orthodoxy has helped to define the Russian nation, a significance that is palpable in these atmospheric spiritual places.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/moscow"
"St Petersburg","The sheer grandeur and history of Russia's imperial capital never fail to amaze, but this is also a city with a revolutionary spirit.\n\nCity of the Tsars\n\nThe creation of westward-looking Peter the Great, St Petersburg was intended from its inception as a display of imperial Russia’s growing status in the world. Fine-tuned by Peter’s successors, who employed a host of European architects to add fabulous palaces and cathedrals to the city’s layout, St Petersburg grew to be the Romanovs’ showcase capital and Russia’s first great, modern city. The capital may have moved back to Moscow following the revolution, but despite all that history has thrown at it, St Petersburg still feels every bit the imperial city with its historic heart largely frozen in time.\n\nVenice of \n\nhe NorthWhether you’re cruising along the elegant canals, crossing one of the 342 bridges in the city, or just watching them being raised in summer over the mighty Neva River at night to allow ships to pass through, you’re never far from water in St Petersburg. This has earned the city unsurprising comparisons to Venice, but the similarities don’t stop there: walking around the historic centre will reveal canals lined by Italianate mansions and broken up by striking plazas adorned with baroque and neoclassical palaces. North of the city centre there are also pristine beaches fringing the Gulf of Finland.\n\nArtistic Powerhouse\n\nSt Petersburg is an almost unrivalled treasure trove of art and culture. You can spend days in the Hermitage, seeing everything from Egyptian mummies to Picassos, while the Russian Museum, spread over four sumptuous palaces, is perhaps the best collection of Russian art in the world. Add to this world-class ballet, opera and classical concerts at the illustrious performance halls, and a slew of big-name music festivals over the summer months, and you won’t be stuck for cultural nourishment. Contemporary art is also available at the fantastic Erarta Museum, the Street Art Museum and in the buzzing gallery scene.\n\nAll Seasons City\n\nSummer White Nights are legendary: the northern sun barely dips below the horizon. Revelry begins in May, with parks and gardens greening with flowering trees, and peaks in mid-June when performing arts festivals pack out concert halls and the entire city seems to party all night long. It's the busiest time to visit and the crowds can often be overwhelming. But Piter, as the city is affectionately known, is just as beautiful in early spring, golden autumn and even winter: the skies may be leaden and the ground covered in snow, but the culture still dazzles and delights.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/moscow"
"Kazan","Kazan (meaning 'cooking pot' in Tatar) is the Istanbul of the Volga, a place where Europe and Asia curiously inspect each other from the tops of church belfries and minarets. It is about 150 years older than Moscow and the capital of the Tatarstan Republic (Республика Татарстан) – the land of the Volga Tatars, a Turkic people commonly associated with Chinggis (Genghis) Khaan’s hordes.\n\nTatar autonomy is strong here and is not just about bilingual street signs. Moscow has pumped vast sums into the republic to persuade it to remain a loyal part of Russia. It also ensures that Tatarstan benefits greatly from the vast oil reserves in this booming republic.\n\nAlthough Tatar nationalism is strong, it is not radical, and the local version of Sunni Islam is very moderate. Slavic Russians make up about half of the population, and this cultural conflux of Slavic and Tatar cultures makes Kazan an all-the-more-interesting city.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/volga-region/kazan"

The city centre is compact and – thanks to lots of parks and tree-lined avenues – it has a quiet, green-fingered air to it, which makes it an ideal city for strolling about. And there's a lot here worth strolling for, including a slew of quirky museums and monuments, some impressive galleries, a good theatre and entertainment scene and some memorable places to eat. All this means it's hard not to like Novosibirsk and, sitting as it does on the main rail line, it makes a worthwhile Trans-Siberian pit stop. You can also jump off from here to architecturally splendid Tomsk, some 4½ hours away by bus.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/siberia/novosibirsk"
"Ekaterinburg","Gem rush, miners’ mythology, the execution of the Romanovs, the rise of Russia's first president, Boris Yeltsin, and legendary gangster feuds of the 1990s – Yekaterinburg is not only Russia's fourth-largest city, it is like a piece of conceptual art with a fascinating historical subtext.\n\nBustling, but less than startling on the outside, the political capital of the Ural Mountains is overflowing with history and culture, while its economic growth is manifested in a thriving restaurant scene and, as in many other regional capitals, in atrociously trafficked avenues.\n\nWith one of the best international airports in Russia and quite a few agencies experienced in dealing with foreign travellers, Yekaterinburg is a good base camp for exploring the Ural Mountains.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/the-urals/yekaterinburg"
"Nizhny Novgorod","Russia's fifth-largest city – sometimes referred to as the country's 'third capital' – would likely go unnoticed by most travellers if not for its arresting hilltop kremlin, overlooking the confluence of two wide rivers: the Volga and Oka. This is the locale where merchant Kuzma Minin and Count Dmitry Pozharsky (men commemorated in a monument in front of Moscow's St Basil’s Cathedral) rallied a popular army to repel the Polish intervention in 1612. It's also the city (then known as 'Gorky') where late Soviet scientist-dissident Andrei Sakharov was banished in the 1980s as punishment for opposing the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nAside from stirring views out over the river (including the possibility of a high-altitude cable-car ride), 'Nizhny' offers several very good museums, and Sakharov's former apartment is home to a quirky exhibition on the great man's life. The port offers the possibility of river excursions to nearby towns.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/volga-region/nizhny-novgorod"
"Samara","The Volga port city of Samara is a major hub for air, rail and river traffic, meaning that any visit to the region is likely to entail a stopover here. While there are few traditional sites beyond an impressive art museum and a quirky WWII-era bunker, the vibe is lively and the restaurants are the best around. On a summer day the riverbanks are packed with bathing beauties, in-line skaters and beer drinkers. Don’t miss the chance to stroll the long and lovely riverside park. Samara also serves as the base for excursions into the nearby Zhiguli Hills.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/volga-region/samara"
"Omsk","Omsk is an industrial, scientific and cultural centre of Siberia. The city can boast various industrial enterprises, two dozen higher educational institutions, six theatres and modern hotels. It attracts businessmen and tourists from other Russian cities and countries. Magnificent churches, cultural sites and Russian hospitality make Omsk a nice holiday destination.\n\nHistorical Overview\n\nOmsk was founded in 1716. On the order of Peter I, Lieutenant Colonel Buchholz landed with a detachment of soldiers and Cossacks at the Om River and founded a fortress which became known as Omsk. This fortress was built to protect Siberia from nomads. The fortress stood there for more than 50 years. In 1768-1771, on the initiative of General I.I. Springer, the commander of the Siberian Corps, a new fortress was built on the right bank of the Om River. It featured improved engineering structures. In August 1782, the Omsk fortress became one of ten district settlements of the Tobolsk governorship, and in October it was given the status of a city.Two independent governorships, West Siberian and East Siberian, were founded in 1822. Omsk was chosen as a place of permanent residence of the governor-general. Later, he asked the government to transfer the Central Administration of Western Siberia from Tobolsk to Omsk. As a result, Omsk became the main city of Western Siberia. The construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway influenced the development of the region and made Omsk a major transportation centre with an advantageous geographic location at the crossroads of the Irtysh River and the mainland railway line. The bridge across the Irtysh River was built in March 1896, when it became the railway line between Chelyabinsk and Novosibirsk. In the 19th-20th centuries, Omsk turned into one of the largest industrial and cultural centres of Western Siberia. New buildings in the classical architectural style appeared in Omsk at the beginning of the 20th century (for example, the Treasury Chamber and the provincial treasury). The Moscow shopping arcade, designed by the famous architect P.V. Dessin, was built on Chernavinsky (Lubinsky) Avenue in 1903.\n\nThe construction of a drama theatre was completed in 1905. The house of judicial institutions, the Railway Administration and other buildings were built during that time. After October 1917, the city became the political centre of Soviet power in Western Siberia. In the period from June 1918 to November 1919, Omsk was the residence of the Supreme Ruler of Russia, Admiral A.V. Kolchak, who declared Omsk the capital of Siberia.\n\nA convenient geographical position, a developed system of institutions and political stability made Omsk one of the largest economic, scientific and cultural centres in Russia. The Trans-Siberian railway, the Irtysh River and the airport ensured its rapid and comprehensive development. Today, the population of Omsk is about 1.3 million people covering more than 110 nationalities.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nMost hotels and guest houses are concentrated in the city centre. Have a look at some of the hotels on Maslennikova Street: Standartoff, Moni Hotel Z or Globus Hotel. You can also stay near the embankment of the Irtysh River at Moloko Hostel or Amaks Omsk Hotel. If you travel on business and stay here for a short time, there are also a few options near the airport. Book Aero Hotel, Nika Spa Hotel, Hotel 41 or Noy Hotel.\n\nBars and Restaurants\n\nAs a modern city, Omsk offers a wide variety of cuisine, from Russian and Georgian to Italian and Japanese. For example, at Lapshichnaya, you can try Asian spice soups and curries. Tamada is a fancy Georgian restaurant, and lobiyo (red beans), fried lamb or khachapuri (bread with cheese) are highly recommended. Kolchak is a mixture of an Irish Pub and a cosy restaurant.\n\nThey offer a wide selection of tap and traditional beverages like vodka or kvas. Tourists also recommend visiting Base, Berlin, Senkevich, Evropa and Lugovskaya Sloboda. For something to drink, have a look at Pushkin Pub and Club or Piter@Pan. There are also lots of cafes to stop off at for a cup of coffee (Coffee Rooms, TinTo Café, Traveller's Coffee or Skuratov).\n\nWhat to See\n\n\ \n\n\The Assumption Cathedral is the biggest cathedral in Omsk, rebuilt after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is included in the list of the world's temple culture and considered to be a unique monument of Russian architecture.Go for a walk along the Irtysh embankment. The promenade along the Irtysh River is very long and reaches as far as the railway station. You can also rent a bicycle and experience the real Omsk atmosphere. It’s one of the favourite places of both locals and tourists. Omsk honeymooners like to take memorable photos here.A former home to Admiral Kolchak’s government, the Art Museum contains a collection of decorative arts.The Lutheran Church of St Catherine is located in the historical part of Omsk. It is the only religious building in the style of Siberian Baroque from the 18th century. This church operated until 1930 and is now the Museum of Internal Affairs of the Omsk region.The Omsk fortress is a popular tourist destination. However, only a few historical and cultural sites have been restored: the Tobolsk Gates, the Omsk, Tarsky and Irtysh, and the Money Pantry. Nowadays, the other buildings of the cultural and historical complex are being restored (the arsenal, the dining room and the engineering workshop).The Tarsky Gate is a symbol of Omsk. It was built in 1792 in honour of the town of Tara. Fyodor Dostoevsky, Russia’s greatest writer, passed through the Tarsky Gate when he was in Omsk. The Gate led to a bastion where there was a prison for convicts.Nikolsky Cathedral of Omsk is one of the oldest churches in the city. The majestic Russian classicism building was designed by the famous architect V. Stasov. It attracts visitors with its high dome, elegant bell tower and bright yellow facade. Here, you will see the miraculous Abalak Icon of the Mother of God, the image of St John of Tobolsk and the relics of the saints. Tourists also admire the magnificent three-tier iconostasis and dome paintings.Omsk Academic Drama Theatre is the oldest theatre in Siberia, built in 1905. It’s a unique piece of Siberian baroque architecture.If you want to find out more about the history of the city, visit the Historical Museum.Here, you will find the skeleton of a woolly mammoth, a French car from the early 20th century, the flag of the Cossack army of 1690, several rare icons, a collection of Old Believers costumes and other interesting items.\n\n\","https://www.visitrussia.org.uk/destinations/siberia/omsk/"
"Chelyabinsk","Industrial and earthy, Chelyabinsk would at first glance seem to be a place best visited as a springboard rather than as a destination in itself, but dig beneath the surface and you'll find a pleasant place to explore. The city has broad avenues, numerous green spaces, and a few interesting museums, with exhibitions spanning everything from modern arts to historical artifacts. One of the most interesting of these is the meteor remnants (Chelyabinsk made headlines as the closest city to the site of a 2013 meteor explosion) displayed at the Chelyabinsk State Museum of Local History.\n\nBeyond the city, the lakes and small towns of the region are pleasant to visit, so it's worth taking the time to stay in this oft-overlooked and underrated city to get a taste of everyday Ural Mountains life.\n\n","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/the-urals/chelyabinsk"
"Rostov-on-Don","Rostov-on-Don (simply ‘Rostov’ to locals) is the gateway to the Northern Caucasus region, the historical hotbed of Cossack culture and peasant uprisings. Nowadays, it’s southern Russia’s largest and most cosmopolitan city. Flowing through the city is the Don River, a geographic and cultural landmark. Most famously, the river is celebrated in Mikhail Sholokhov’s novels of the Russian Civil War, And Quiet Flows the Don and The Don Flows Home to the Sea.\n\nRostov is a pleasant city of green parks and monumental squares. It makes a good stopover on the way to the Black Sea coast and a base for several interesting day trips in the area.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/russian-caucasus/rostov-on-don"
"Lisbon","Seven cinematic hillsides overlooking the Rio Tejo cradle Lisbon's postcard-perfect panorama of cobbled alleyways, ancient ruins and white-domed cathedrals – a captivating scene crafted over centuries.\n\nBeyond Bacalhau: Lisbon for Foodies\n\nDining in Lisbon is far more dynamic than navigating countless preparations of Portugal's beloved bacalhau (dried and salted cod fish; 365 recipes and counting!). While bacalhau à Brás (shredded cod with onions, eggs and potatoes; a Bairro Alto original) is never far, Lisbon's strategic seaside position on Europe's doorstep means a bounty of fresh seafood (octopus, tuna, monkfish, shrimp, sardines, clams, snails) rules the city's kitchens, from Michelin-starred restaurants to gourmet-food markets to countless corner tascas (taverns). Top-grade Alentejan beef beckons with juicy steaks and gourmet burgers, and you'll find everything from tantalising Indian curries to authentic Moroccan couscous in between.\n\nLast Call, Lisbon!\n\nCheap booze and the absence of open-container laws means Lisbon loves a night on the town! Don't be fooled by Bairro's Alto's sleepy daytime feel – by night, these narrow cobbled lanes transform into one of Europe's most raucous drinking locales. Student dives, traditional fado houses, upscale wine bars and LGBT hot spots merrihttps://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/lisbonly coexist among the muddled mess. In Cais do Sodré, Pink Street and environs are home to some of the city's classic nightclubs and rowdiest cocktail bars, while trendier megaclubs stretch along the waterfront from Santos to Santa Apolónia. Last call? Sunrise!\n\nThe Great Lisbon Earthquake\n\nYou couldn't blame your average lisboêta for thinking of the Apocalypse when the ground gave way just before 10am on 1 November, 1755. What followed was eight astonishing minutes of city-shattering shaking spread across three tremors, followed 40 minutes later by a massive, city-engulfing tsunami, culminating in a week-long firestorm that incinerated what little was initially spared. Lisbon was decimated. Today, the modern city is shaped by these cataclysmic events – nearly everything is defined as before or after the earthquake – and the Pombaline architecture that defined post-quake Lisbon reconstruction was some of the first seismically protected building in Europe.\n\nMiradouro Mania: Scenic City Views\n\nLisbon's trademark seven hills are spread across the cityscape like lofty guardians of colour and history. Capped by a collection of terraces known as miradouros (viewpoints), a must-see web of no-filter-necessary views over Lisbon, the Tejo and beyond is formed. Our favourite miradouros – Portas do Sol, São Pedro de Alcântara, da Graça, da Senhora do Monte, Santa Luzia and, of course, Castelo de São Jorge – all offer stunning spots to get your bearings and while away afternoons over bica (espresso), elegant glasses of Touriga Nacional or refreshing pitchers of sangria, while rubbernecking the city's stupendous horizons.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/lisbon"
"Porto","Opening up like a pop-up book from the banks of the Rio Douro, edgy-yet-opulent Porto entices with its historic centre, sumptuous food and wine, and charismatic locals.\n\nSnapshots of Local Life\n\nPorto’s charms are as subtle as the nuances of an aged tawny port, best savoured slowly on a romp through the hilly backstreets of Miragaia, Ribeira and Massarelos. It’s the quiet moments of reflection and the snapshots of daily life that you’ll remember most: the slosh of the Douro against the docks; the snap of laundry drying in river winds; the sound of port glasses clinking; the sight of young lovers discreetly tangled under a landmark bridge, on the rim of a park fountain, in the crumbling notch of a graffiti-blasted wall…\n\nStreet Art & Cutting-Edge Architecture\n\nBeyond Porto’s alley-woven historic heart, contemporary architects have left their idiosyncratic stamp on the city’s skyline. Winging Porto into the 21st century is Álvaro Siza Vieira’s crisply minimalist Museu de Arte Contemporânea and Rem Koolhaas’ daringly iconic Casa da Música. Public art is everywhere, from azulejos (hand-painted tiles) glamming up the metro to street art tattooed across crumbling medieval walls. Costah and Hazul, who always work incognito, have blazed their patterns along the streets of the Aliados, Miragaia and Massarelos.\n\nFoodie Porto: Port Wine & Beyond\n\nWith much-lauded chefs like Pedro Lemos, Ricardo Costa, Rui Paula and José Avillez shaking the pans, the city's culinary star continues to rise. Take Vasco Coelho Santos at the new Euskalduna Studio, for instance, wowing with highly experimental 10-course menus, Vítor Matos at Michelin-starred Antiqvvm, or José Cordeiro at The Blini, an upscale marisquería putting stunning riffs on Atlantic-fresh seafood in Gaia. Petiscarias (Portuguese-style tapas bars), gourmet steakhouses, brunch cafes, hallowed port cellars, craft beer bars, food markets – you name it, Porto nails it. Bom apetite!\n\nMiradouros, Gardens & Coastal \n\nalks\n\nPorto holds you captive at its sky-high miradouros (lookouts) and on-trend roof terrace bars. From the Sé cathedral terrace and Gaia’s hilltop Jardim do Morro, the city is reduced to postcard format: a colourful tumbledown dream with soaring bell towers, extravagant baroque churches and stately beaux arts buildings. Equally ravishing is Jardins do Palácio de Cristal’s palm-fringed, fountain-speckled gardens. Even in the city's heart, seagulls soar on Atlantic breezes, and a rickety ride on tram 1 trundles to the wide open ocean in Foz do Douro in minutes.\n\nWhy I love Porto\n\nBy Kerry Christiani, Writer\n\nBeyond Porto’s more obvious charms – the river, the port \n\nodges, the alley-woven historic centre – it’s the city’s soulfulness that makes it that bit special. Revealing itself little by little, Porto is made for exploring on foot, and you never know quite where those thigh-challenging steps or back alleys will lead you. The laid-back vibe, ludicrously beautiful viewpoints and relentlessly hospitable locals make this an easy city to love. High-spirited nightlife, outstanding food, wine tasting, street art, avant-garde design, mood-lifting ocean views – you name it, Porto pulls it off time and again.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/the-north/porto"
"Amadora","Until recently, Amadora was a predominantly rural area, but it is now a highly developed town, although it has preserved some interesting monuments. Marking the boundary with the city of Lisbon, are the Portas de Benfica, a curious construction from the early 20th century with eight turrets, where traffic used to pay a fee, like an old-fashioned toll.\n\nCasa Roque Gameiro is an essential visit, not just because it is the former home of the painter and houses part of his collection, but also because it is a perfect example of the architectural concept of the Casa Portuguesa.\n\nAn important archaeological discovery in 1932 was the Grutas de Carenque, dating back to the third millennium bce. Fundamental for an understanding of Portuguese prehistory, the caves are a necropolis with three collective sepulchres carved out of the rock, examples of Mediterranean burial culture. Guided  visits can be arranged by appointment at the Museu Municipal de Arqueologia da Amadora.\n\nIt is also in Amadora that the Aqueduto das Águas Livres begins, and the Mãe d'Água Nova and Mãe d'Água Velha are both open to visitors.\n\nWhile you are here, visit the Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Lapa.","https://www.visitlisboa.com/pt-pt/regions/arredores-de-lisboa/amadora"
"Braga","Portugal’s third-largest city is an elegant town laced with ancient narrow lanes closed to vehicles, strewn with plazas and a splendid array of baroque churches. The constant chiming of bells is a reminder of Braga’s age-old devotion to the spiritual world. Its religious festivals – particularly the elaborately staged Semana Santa (Holy Week) – are famous throughout Portugal. But don’t come expecting piety alone: Braga’s upscale old centre is packed with lively cafes and trim boutiques, some excellent restaurants and low-key bars catering to students from the Universidade do Minho.\n\nJust east of the city stands the magnificent, much-visited hillside church and sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte, one of Portugal's most iconic tourist attractions.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/the-north/braga"
"Setúbal","The thriving port town of Setúbal (shtoo-bahl) makes a terrific base for exploring the region’s natural assets. Top of the must-do list is a cruise to the marshy wetlands of the Sado estuary, the splashy playground of bottlenose dolphins, flocks of white storks (spring and summer), and wintering flamingos that make the water fizz like pink champagne. You can hike or bike along the dramatic, pine-brushed coastline of Parque Natural da Arrábida, or simply soak up rays on nearby sandy beaches.\n\nBack in town, it’s worth taking a stroll through the squares in the pedestrianised old town and clambering up to the hilltop fortress for views over the estuary. The fish reeled the Romans to Setúbal in 412, so it’s no surprise that seafood here is delicious. On Avenida Luísa Todi, locals happily while away hours polishing off enormous platters of choco frito and carafes of white wine.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/lisbon/setubal"
"Coimbra","Rising scenically from the Rio Mondego, Coimbra is an animated city steeped in history. It was Portugal’s medieval capital for more than a century and it's home to the country’s oldest and most prestigious university. Its steeply stacked historic centre dates to Moorish times and is wonderfully atmospheric, with its dark cobbled lanes and monumental cathedral. On summer evenings, the city’s old stone walls reverberate with the haunting metallic notes of the guitarra (Portuguese guitar) and the full, deep voices of fado singers.\n\nThe city is at its best during university term time, when the students bring a youthful energy to the streets, thronging bars and partying at weekends. Their presence also adds a political edge – witness the graffiti scrawled outside the repúblicas (communal student dwellings) addressing the political issues of the day.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/central-portugal/coimbra"
"Queluz","In the city of Queluz, we highlight two extremely important monuments, the beautiful Palace of Queluz, often called the Portuguese Versailles and the D. Maria I Guesthouse, which once housed the Royal Guard of the King.\n\nThe Palace of Queluz with beautiful décor filled with pieces of enormous value, became the official royal residence, in particular, the Portuguese Prince Regent, the future D. João VI, as well as his family, to the Royal family's escape to Brazil because of the French invasions. In this Palace D. Pedro IV or D. Pedro I of Brazil was born. He also served as a discreet place of incarceration for Queen Maria I, The Insane, while her madness continued to worsen after the death of D. Pedro.","https://www.portugalrotasetours.com/pt/tour/tour-queluz-sintra"

It’s also the busiest part of the island with yellow buses, street cafes and shoppers from outside Funchal packing the streets from morning until sundown.\n\nEast Funchal is all about the Zona Velha, an old fishers’ neighbourhood that until recently was a rundown and almost lifeless area. Today it’s been transformed into a hip quarter packed with bars, galleries, shops and restaurants and is the place to head in Funchal come nightfall. The stellar attraction on the edge of the Zona Velha is the Mercado dos Lavradores, Funchal’s vibrant market.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/funchal"
"Cacem","Santiago do Cacém is a peaceful town in the south of Portugal, whose origins date back to remote times. In the Roman period, it was an important town situated on the road linking Lisbon to the Algarve, a factor which greatly contributed to its development.\n\nThe definitive Christian conquest of the town took place in the thirteenth century in 1217, being achieved by the forces led by D. Afonso II, although there had been an earlier conquest in 1157 by the Knights Templar. It was around this time that the castle originally founded by the Moors was rebuilt. Other buildings of historical and architectural interest are the thirteenth-century parish church and the seventeenth-century chapel of São Pedro.\n\nNo visit to this region would be complete without a trip to the nearby ruins of Miróbriga, an important livestock farming centre and spa in Roman times. The archaeological site includes an important urban nucleus encompassing a hippodrome, several houses (some of which have mural paintings) and a clearly defined acropolis, where the forum and public baths are quite visible.","https://www.visitportugal.com/en/NR/exeres/2E42BEB7-3958-463F-9601-89A6C3A1B4F2"
"Vila Nova de Gaia","Vila Nova de Gaia (simply 'Gaia' to locals) wings you back to the 17th-century beginnings of port-wine production, when British merchants transformed wine into the post-dinner tipple of choice by adding a dash of brandy.

Edmonton is often a stopover en route to Jasper National Park, which is four hours' drive west, or for explorations into the vast and empty landscape to the north.\n\nDowntown has changed a lot in the past few years since Roger's Place was completed. Chic upscale shops and eateries are in stark contrast to the homeless outside. For the soul of the city, head south of the river to the university district and Whyte Ave, home to small theaters, diners and a spirited Friday-night mood. Edmonton also has a few decent museums, an annual fringe festival second only to Edinburgh's, and some top nearby sights like the Ukrainian Cultural Village and Elk Island National Park.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/alberta/edmonton"
"Mississauga","Toronto’s largest suburb, Mississauga is Canada’s sixth most populated city. It sits to the west of Toronto on the shores of Lake Ontario, spanning for over 280 square kilometres.\n\nAlthough Mississauga was only established as a city in 1974, it dates back to the 1600s when European settlers arrived. It later became a town, followed by having city status, but due to its history, it is home to plenty of historic sites. It is also home to Lester B. Pearson International Airport, which is Canada’s largest and busiest air hub. Today Mississauga is still growing and is fast becoming a major business centre. It also has a thriving arts community, shopping centres, recreational areas and quant villages.","https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-best-things-mississauga-ontario-canada/"
"North York","The capital of Ontario, Toronto is the epitome of Canada cool. Be sure to make the 90-minute drive to Niagara Falls and soak up the view from the ‘prettier’ side of the falls. Root for hometown ice-hockey heroes the Toronto Maple Leafs, or watch baseball’s Blue Jays and NBA’s Toronto Raptors in action. Take in some history at the Royal Ontario Museum, shop until you drop at Eaton Centre and sample cuisines from all over the world thanks to the city’s diverse population. Head to the Entertainment District for a night on the town, or check out the edgy music scene at Massey Hall or Glenn Gould Studio.","https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Downtown-Toronto/North-York"
"Winnipeg","Winnipeg surprises. Rising above the prairie, it's a metropolis where you least expect it. Cultured, confident and captivating, it's more than just a pit stop on the Trans-Canada haul, but a destination in its own right, with a couple of world-class museums and a wonderfully diverse dining scene. Explore its boom of craft beer breweries and specialty coffee shops, wander its historic neighborhoods and lap up a vibe that both enjoys being the butt of a Simpsons joke ('That's it! Back to Winnipeg!') and revels in one of the world's best fringe theater festivals.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/manitoba/winnipeg"
"Vancouver","Explorable neighborhoods, drink-and-dine delights and memorable cultural and outdoor activities framed by striking natural vistas – there's a superfluity of reasons to fall for this ocean-fringed metropolis.\n\nTaste-Tripping\n\nDon't tell the rest of the country but Vancouver is Canada’s dine-out capital. Abandon your diet and dive right into North America's best Asian cuisine, from chatty Chinese restaurants to Vietnamese banh mi sandwich joints, or unleash your appetite on a rich smorgasbord of fresh-caught local seafood, including seasonal spot prawns and succulent wild salmon. The farm-to-table movement has also reinvigorated West Coast cuisine here – anyone for Fraser Valley lamb with a side of foraged morels? And we haven't even started on Vancouver’s thirst-slaking craft-beer scene, pouring the nation’s finest IPAs, sours and more.\n\nNeighbourhood Villages\n\nDowntown is just the start of Vancouver. Walk or hop public transit and within minutes you'll be hanging with the locals in one of the city's diverse and distinctive mini-districts. Whether discovering the independent boutiques of Main St or the coffee shops of Commercial Dr, the redbrick bars of Gastown or the heritage-house beachfronts of Kitsilano, you'll find this city ideal for easy-access urban exploration. Just be sure to chat to the locals wherever you go: they might seem shy or aloof at first, but Vancouverites love talking up their town and regaling you with their personal recommendations.\n\nCulture Hub\n\nThere's a multi-textured canvas of creativity to pore over in this city. Dig deeply and you'll find an eclectically diverse grassroots scene that operates like a locavore movement for culture fans. Mingle with the regulars at indie festivals, sparkling theatrical events, toe-tapping live music, waterfront Shakespeare shows and a camera-ready menagerie of eye-popping public art. There’s also a savor-worthy menu of independent galleries, a large public gallery that’s about to break-ground on a grand new building, and a huge, party-like open-house art crawl that lures locals and visitors every November.\n\nOutdoor Wonderland\n\nThose snow-capped giants peeking at you from between downtown's glass towers? They're less than 30 minutes away by car. Vancouverites really can ski in the morning and hit the beach in the afternoon – although it's far more relaxing to chill out and take your time. The city's North Shore nature doorstep offers snow sports, mountain biking and rainforest hiking trails, while the city itself is studded with sandy shorelines, kayaking routes, verdant gardens and Canada's urban green-space jewel, the mighty and highly beloved Stanley Park.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/vancouver"
"Warsaw","The capital of Poland is a meeting place for politicians, economists and artists of all nationalities.Warsaw's 1.7 million inhabitants are known for their sense of humour and hard-working tradition. It took them 15 years, with the help of the entire nation, to rebuild their beloved city — 84% of which was razed to the ground during World War II.\n\nThe scenic Old Town and its Market Square, with its mansard-roofed houses, attract artists and tourists. Here, the wine cellars and elegant restaurants are buzzing, and there is always a table waiting for new guests. Warsaw's St John's Cathedral is the national Pantheon and not far from it is the King's Castle, which was the residence of the last Polish king. The most elegant houses in Warsaw line the Royal Route, which links the three royal residences: the King's Castle, Łazienki Palace and Park and Wilanów Palace. Among the numerous neo-classical buildings in Royal Łazienki Park, the most impressive is the Palace on the Water, which is on a picturesque island. A particularly beautiful landmark is the Frederic Chopin Monument. The music of Frederic Chopin is played here by celebrated pianists every Sunday in summer.\n\nWilanów Palace is an outstanding example of the Baroque style in Poland. It belonged to King Jan III Sobieski, who is remembered for his victory over the Turks at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Like other major cities in Europe, Warsaw offers a great variety of entertainment, including theatre, cabaret shows, film festivals and concerts by famous opera soloists, pop stars and classical music performers. Warsaw hosts one of the world's most prestigious cultural events: the Chopin International Piano Competition, which is organised every five years. The city also hosts the International Festival of Contemporary Music, Warsaw Autumn, and the Mozart Festival.\n\nToday Warsaw is a city with many faces where tradition mingles with modernity.\n\nFrom the terrace on Zamkowy Square, where the Royal Castle and St. Anne's Church are located, there is an excellent view of the brand new Świętokrzyski Bridge. The familiar, dominant silhouette of the Palace of Culture and Science in the city centre now shares the city's skyline with numerous modern office towers.

"Szczecin","Szczecin - capital of West PomeraniaSzczecin the historic capital of the West Pomerania region is situated at the beginning of the estuary of the Oder River (Odra), some 65 km from the Baltic Sea. Many centuries ago this region was the ducal territory of the aristocratic Griffin dynasty and the scene of stormy history which saw the numerous incorporations of Szczecin into other countries, Sweden, Prussia and Poland. For centuries this was a land of cross roads, from Western to Eastern Europe and from Scandinavia to Southern Europe. Today Szczecin is not only the capital city of the West Pomeranian Province but is also the major city of the whole Pomerania Euroregion. It has become the centre of trade and industry, education and culture and a place with a developing tourist industry. Although the old image of the city has greatly changed it still enchants visitors with its charming places of interest and secession architecture which in itself is an invitation to explore and see more of the city.\n\nFollow the red line\n\nAs you walk through the city you may notice a broken red line running along the pavement, the meaning of which is a mystery to many people. In fact this is a special way of marking the tourist route that can lead you to the most important sights in Szczecin. During a walk that may last a few hours you can visit the Old Market and see its most spectacular sights. The route starts near the main railway station (Dworzec Główny PKP) and leads us around forty two landmarks. Many people visiting the city will without doubt appreciate the help of this special route map, which is 'printed' in Polish, English and German. A must-see tourist destination is the Dukes of Pomerania Castle (Zamek Książąt Pomorskich), which was once the centre of the aristocratic Pomeranian Griffin dynasty. It was extensively damaged during Allied air raids in 1944 and rebuilt after the war in the Renaissance style. The castle has five wings, two courtyards and four prominent towers soaring above the panorama of the city centre. It is worthwhile stopping in the largest courtyard, below the astronomic clock that has been 'counting' time since 1693. Aficionados of older architecture styles will be delighted to see the unique City Gates dating from the 18th century and whose richly ornamented facades resemble triumphal arches. Another place worth visiting is St. Jacob's Cathedral. It dates back to the 12th century and has been rebuilt several times. Its interiors are truly impressive. There are Gothic triptychs, Baroque tombs, a baptismal font and numerous epitaphs. Below the altar is the reliquary with the relics of St. Otton. On the eastern wall is the largest stained glass window in Pomorze Zachodnie (87 sq m), depicting the Mother of the Church with the Infant, the Holy Spirit and other figures who had some part in the history of the church in the Szczecin region. In front of the Cathedral you cannot overlook the Bell called, 'The Great Bell' ('Wielki') dating from 1682. The house on the corner of Farna Street (ul. Farna) and Mariacki Square (pl. Mariackiego) is of particular interest because it is here that on 2nd May 1729 Sophie Augusta Frederica von Anhalt-Zerbst, the future Tsarina of Russia, Catherine II, was born.\n\nHarbour city\n\nThe city of Szczecin, with its bridges, cranes and dockyards stretches along the banks of the Oder River (Odra). The seaport of Szczecin-Świnoujście as well as the shipyard, fourth in size in Europe, gives Szczecin a unique maritime character. The distinctive embankment, the so called Chrobry's Walls (Wały Chrobrego) is the emblem of the capital of West Pomerania.The Walls are 500 metre long terraces which were constructed at the initiative of Hermann Haken, who was the mayor of Szczecin at the beginning of 20th century. Wały Chrobrego are located in a very special place as they are in the proximity of the impressive architecture of the public utility buildings, the Maritime University, the National Museum and the Province Office. From here you have a splendid view extending over the right bank of the Oder, its estuary and port canals, islands and the harbour. It will come as no surprise that this is one of the most popular places for promenades for the citizens of Szczecin. It is here that the summer festival, Days of the Sea, is held. At the bottom of Chrobry's Walls is one of the most beautiful squares in Szczecin – Defenders of Westerplatte Square (Plac Obrońców Westerplatte), adorned with a huge fountain incorporated in the stone of the Walls. On the both sides of the fountain, in niches above mascarons there are two monuments. On the left is Jan z Kolna (Jan with an anchor), the legendary discoverer of America, and on the right there is Jan Wyszak (holding a ship's wheel), corsair from Szczecin, miraculously saved from Danish captivity. From here the Marine Station (Dworzec Morski) is just a short distance and we recommend a one-hour boat trip around the harbour and the entry to the shipyard, where in their gantries, 'marine giants', are under construction.\n\nAn echo of Paris on the Oder\n\nWhen entering the Grunwaldzki Square (Plac Grunwaldzki), the largest square in Szczecin, it is important to know that it was built after the fashion of the Star, the l'Etiolle in Paris, the round meeting point of eight radial streets. The Parisian architect, Haussmann, is to be credited with the design of these star-like meetings points joining squares and roads in Paris. A replica, on a smaller scale of the Parisian model of a wide, plant and treelined avenue lined with contemporary art, leads from Grunwaldzki Square to the Provincial Office. You will not find the Eiffel Tower in Szczecin but we recommend a cup of coffee in Café 22 a mere 80 metre above ground for the spectacular view of the Old and New Town.\n\nOmnipresent greenery\n\nSzczecin is a real paradise for those fond of walking. As much as 20 per cent of the area of the city is filled by parks and greenery. Park Kasprowicza is without doubt the most popular spot in the city. It was established in the 19th century and covers 49 ha of uneven hills. Its diverse, exotic plants attract visitors in all seasons. Here you will find shady, quiet paths as well as sunny clearings, the picturesque Rusałka Lake, lively playgrounds, a café and an open air theater. The Polish Community Work Monument (Pomnik Czynu Polaków) is definitely worth a stop. It represents three bronze eagles rising from a nest, symbolizing the three generations of Polish people who reconstructed Szczecin after the war. Jasne Błonia, a bright, verdant area of land spread out to the north of City Hall is another place that visitors should not miss. The park has been designed around the rows of plane trees at the sides of the vast lawn containing flower beds. The more than two hundred trees, which are on the Natural Monuments list, give Jasne Błonia a unique charm. In the centre of the park there is a monument to John Paul II, commemorating his visit in 1987. Visiting the Central Cemetery, one of the largest burial grounds in Europe, is also highly recommended. It is spread over more than 160 ha. On entering the grounds through the neo-romantic Main Gate from the street with a very meaningful name, 'Towards the Sun' ('Ku Słońcu') visitors will quickly notice that the cemetery resembles a park with many species of trees and shrubs, often exotic ones, such as the Serbian spruce, the Korean fir and the maidenhair tree. The Emerald Lake (Jezioro Szmaragdowe) which is outside the city, right in the heart of the Bukowa Forest (Puszcza Bukowa) captivates visitors with its magical air. Its name is derived from the colour of the water which fills the former chalk mine. Nearby from the viewing terrace there is a panorama of the lower Oder and the city of Szczecin.\n\nCultural Castle\n\nOnce the historic seat of the aristocratic Pomerania Griffin dynasty the castle was rebuilt after the destruction of war and now houses The Pomeranian Dukes' Castle Institute and is one of the most important centers of culture in West Pomerania. Chamber music, classical music concerts as well as choir recitals, among them, Candlelit Chamber Music Concerts and the Promenade Concerts during summertime are held in a small courtyard with the Stage Concerts held in the larger courtyard. Among the performers are ensembles and soloists from all over the world (Goran Bregovič, Vadim Brodsky, Jose Carreras, Jean-Marc Fessard, Barbara Hendricks, Konstanty Andrzej Kulka, Chuck Mangione, Valerij Oistrach, Pat Metheny, Al di Meola). The castle contains art galleries and every year some forty exhibitions, photography, history and art, are held.","https://www.poland.travel/en/cities/szczecin-–-the-historic-capital-of-the-west-pomerania"

"Amsterdam","Golden Age canals lined by tilting gabled buildings are the backdrop for Amsterdam's treasure-packed museums, vintage-filled shops and hyper-creative drinking, dining and design scenes.\n\nUrban Explorations\n\nAmsterdam's canal-woven core is laced by atmospheric narrow lanes. You never know what you'll find: a tiny hidden garden; a boutique selling witty, stylised Dutch-designed homewares and fashion; a jewel-box-like jenever (Dutch gin) distillery; a flower stall filled with tulips in a rainbow of hues; an old monastery-turned-classical-music-venue; an ultra-niche restaurant such as an all-avocado specialist or one reinventing age-old Dutch classics. Fringing the centre, post-industrial buildings in up-and-coming neighbourhoods now house creative enterprises, from art galleries to craft breweries and cutting-edge tech start-ups, as well as some of Europe's hottest clubs.\n\nAdmiring Art\n\nYou can't walk a kilometre without bumping into a masterpiece in the city. The Van Gogh Museum hangs the world's largest collection by tortured native son Vincent. A few blocks away, Vermeers, Rembrandts and other Golden Age treasures fill the glorious Rijksmuseum. The Museum het Rembrandthuis offers more of Rembrandt via his etching-packed studio, while the Stedelijk Museum counts Matisses and Mondrians among its modern stock. And for blockbuster displays, the Hermitage Amsterdam delivers: the outpost of Russia's State Hermitage Museum sifts through its three-million-piece home trove to mount mega exhibitions.\n\nBike & Boat Travel\n\nTwo-wheeling is a way of life here. It's how Amsterdammers commute to work, go to the shop, and meet a date for dinner. Abundant bike-hire shops make it easy to gear up and take a spin. If locals aren't on a bike, they may well be on the water. With its canals and massive harbour, this city reclaimed from the sea offers countless opportunities to drift. Hop aboard a canal boat (preferably an open-air one) or one of the free ferries behind Centraal Station, or rent your own for a wind-in-your-hair ride.\n\nFeel Gezellig\n\nAmsterdam is famously gezellig, a Dutch quality that translates roughly as 'convivial' or 'cosy'. It's more easily experienced than defined. There's a sense of time stopping, an intimacy of the here-and-now that leaves your troubles behind, at least until tomorrow. The easiest place to encounter this feeling is a bruin café (brown cafe; traditional drinking establishment). Named for their wood panelling and walls once stained by smoke, brown cafes have gezelligheid (cosiness) on tap, along with good beer. You can also feel gezellig lingering after dinner in snug restaurants while the candles burn low.\n\n","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/amsterdam"
"Rotterdam","Innovation is the mantra in the Netherlands' second city, and the locals embrace it with an enthusiasm that makes a visit here an exciting proposition.\n\nInnovation City\n\nWhen German and allied bombers targeted Rotterdam in 1940 in WWII they left Rotterdammers with a daunting challenge – rebuilding the city almost from the ground up. An intrepid and visionary lot, the local authorities determined that their new city would be a modern metropolis rather than an ersatz recreation of a Golden Age port. This embrace of the contemporary with its vote of confidence in the future is something that has characterised the city ever since, resulting in a culture that is built on innovation – it's a city where cutting-edge design is enthusiastically adopted and underpins daily life.\n\nArchitecture & Urban Design\n\nTourist arrivals in Rotterdam are increasing every year and it's clear to everyone what the main attraction is: the city's world-class architecture and urban design. The local municipality has long been a crusader for innovative, sustainable and exciting architecture, and has shaped the physical form of the modern city to accommodate this. Projects such as the reimagining of the former docklands at Kop van Zuid (South Bank), home to the iconic De Rotterdam tower designed by superstar architect Rem Koolhaas; the magnificent Centraal Station redevelopment; the iconic Erasmus Bridge; and the utterly unique Markthal (Market Hall) make exploring in Rotterdam both eye-opening and hugely enjoyable.\n\nCafe Culture\n\nInnovation here takes many forms, and one that is immediately apparent is the quality of the coffee served in the city's huge array of cafes. Until recently, there was only one coffee roastery in Rotterdam – the excellent Man Met Brill – but at last count there were 12, all roasting direct-trade beans to caffeinate coffee-obsessed locals. Cafes of every type (hipster hole-in-the-walls to traditional grand cafes) dot the city streets, functioning as work and study spaces for the digital generation as well as places where friends and family catch up over a drink or casual meal.\n\nWaterways\n\nRotterdam's character was forged by its location on the New and Old Maas Rivers, close to the North Sea, and it is proud of its status as the largest port in Europe. Daily life involves lots of water-related action, with people driving or walking over a slew of graceful, architect-designed bridges; zipping from one riverbank to the other in bargain-priced watertaxis; or sauntering along picturesque inner-city canals. While here, visitors should do the same, as well as take a boat tour or board a fast ferry to visit nearby destinations including Dordrecht and Kinderdijk.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/rotterdam"
"The Hague","The Hague has certainly earned its reputation as the Netherlands’ royal city by the sea, with sprawling palaces, coastal views, and a rich history all to be discovered.\n\nAs the seat of the country’s parliament and residence of the Dutch royal family, exploring The Hague reveals a wealth of historic monuments, quaint neighbourhoods and hip hangouts. The Hague (or Den Haag in Dutch) also offers both luxury and a laidback attitude: the city has some of the most stunning palaces and museums, but its location on the coast makes it a haven for beach bums and people seeking a retreat that's perfect for taking some time out from the stresses and strains of everyday life.\n\nWhether you’re getting dressed up for a night out at one of the Netherlands’ swankiest spots or looking to let your hair down, spending time in The Hague offers you a Dutch experience unlike any other.

"Utrecht","It's hard not to fall in love with Utrecht, one of the Netherlands' oldest urban centres and for centuries its religious heart. Now a vibrant university city, the compact medieval core radiates out from the iconic 15th-century Domtoren, ringed by a loop of very pretty tree-lined canals. Their central sections have distinctive double-level sides inset with what were once medieval warehouses – many now forming fascinating venues to eat, drink, dance or sleep, with terrace-walkways that extend right to the waterside. The brilliant cafe culture goes well beyond the canals – Utrecht's vibrant concert schedules are a big draw and, if the budget stretches, it's worth luxuriating in one of numerous historic mansions that have been turned into indulgent boutique hotels.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/the-randstad/utrecht-city"
"Eindhoven","If you find yourself in the Netherlands' fifth-biggest city it's probably for an international budget flight or to watch a football match at PSV's Philips Stadium. But Eindhoven is also a vibrant centre for creative design and post-industrial reinvention. OK, so visually the townscape has all the charm of Minsk on a bad hair day, but before rushing on, do at least consider visiting the fascinating Philips Museum, which tells the story of the global electronics company that essentially created modern Eindhoven. There's also a highly thought-provoking modern-art gallery and a UFO-shaped quirk of 1960s architecture.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/eindhoven"
"Tilburg","'Jug city' Tilburg could never be described as pretty, but dig a little and you'll find a lot of spirit, superb beer and an impressive attempt at regeneration. An award-winning textiles museum remembers Tilburg's proud industrial heritage, the once-derelict Spoorzone northeast of the station is now a crucible of creativity (www.spoorzone013.nl) and the Dwaalgebied's few streets of 19th-century brick houses are dotted with delightful eateries and a cool hostel. A joyful carnival, huge annual street fair and substantial student presence keep Tilburg humming. And in the contrastingly contemplative leafy confines of Koenigshoeven Abbey, monks brew what were (until 2012) the Netherlands' only Trappist beers.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/tilburg"
"Groningen","Looking at a map of the Netherlands, Groningen seems a long way from anywhere – but this vibrant, youthful city is among the country's most progressive urban metropolises, with a 40,000-strong student population injecting bags of creative zest into its buzzing cafe culture, hedonistic nightlife and rampant cultural scene.\n\nGroningen was already an independent city-state and key trading centre by the late Middle Ages; the iconic Martinitoren stands as a reminder of this Golden Age, miraculously surviving fierce fighting here late in WWII before Groningen's liberation on 17 April 1945. Groningen's highly regarded university dates to 1614, and its refreshingly car-free centre is a result of zealous town planning in the 1970s that saw the city controversially get rid of motorised traffic from its old town. Dozens of Dutch cities followed suit, but it is pioneering Groningen that remains one of the country's most brilliant cycling cities.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/the-north-and-east/groningen-city"
"Almere","Almere is a new planned city in the Netherlands. It is in the province of Flevoland in the west of Holland. The local area around Almere was very rural and it was thought that the land should be used for agriculture, but after the war the need for new housing was thought to be more important, especially as the area in and around Amsterdam had lost so much housing due to bombing and war damage.\n\nHistory of Almere\n\nAlmere has a very short but explosive history. From being nothing but fields and farmland in the early 1970’s Almere has quickly grown and expanded into to the 7th largest city in the Netherlands, and the fastest growing city in Europe. After the Second World War There had been much devastation of the housing stock in Holland, both due to the Allied and German bombing and the damage inflicted as the Germans were driven out of the country and the Netherlands was liberated.\n\nIn Amsterdam much of the populous had been displaced and much of the traditional housing stock had been destroyed. With the return of the cities inhabitants came many more, who seeing no future for employment and betterment in the small towns and rural areas that had been liberated, saw their future in the capital and its surrounding areas. So a great deal of housing was needed very quickly and plans were drawn up in the years that followed for many new urban areas. And also the new town of Almere to pick up the people who were trying to find housing in nearby Amsterdam.\n\nSince the completion of its first buildings in the mid 1970’s, Almere has grown at an exponential rate right up to its present day population of, just under 200,000.\n\nAlmere Netherlands – Travel to and around\n\nIf you are flying into Almere then you will arrive at Amsterdam Schipol Airport.

"Breda","Viewed from beside the Hoge Brug, Breda is as pretty as a picture: the Gothic church tower rises majestically above the fine old houses (now bars) of Vismarktstraat, while boats and the sturdy (if inaccessible) bastion-gates of Breda Castle reflect in the calm water of a canal junction. Beyond lies a small old-town area and a pretty park that backs on to the charming Begijnhof, but the real delight of a visit to Breda is to dive into its vibrant cafe scene, especially during the citywide jazz-fest in early May.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/breda"
"Nijmegen","From Roman camp to Catholic university town of 13,000 students, Nijmegen buzzes with energy and is vibrant place to spend a couple of days. This is the oldest town in the Netherlands, with a compact medieval centre yet all the urban-cool of a big city. Historic cafes, specialist craft-coffee shops and a decent smattering of museums and monuments lace its streets that stagger gently from the 16th-century Lower Town by the banks of the Waal River to the older Upper Town. In summer, Dutch party lovers pour into town for its annual four-day hiking fest and Zomerfeesten music festival.","https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/nijmegen"
